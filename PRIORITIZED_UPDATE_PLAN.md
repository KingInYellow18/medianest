## 🗓️ 3-Phase Migration Strategy

### 📅 Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (Week 1)
**Priority: Critical | Effort: 8-12 hours**

#### 1.1 React Version Standardization (Critical)
```bash
# Fix version inconsistency immediately
cd performance-analysis
npm install react@19.1.0 react-dom@19.1.0 @types/react@19.1.0 @types/react-dom@19.1.0
```

#### 1.2 Safe Maintenance Updates
```bash
npm update next prettier eslint-plugin-prettier
```

#### 1.3 Node.js Types Assessment
- **Decision Point:** Evaluate if Node.js 24 upgrade is feasible
- **If Yes:** Update @types/node to 24.1.0 and plan runtime upgrade  
- **If No:** Keep @types/node at 20.x for now

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All packages use React 19.1.0
- ✅ Safe updates applied without issues
- ✅ Full test suite passes
- ✅ Build and deployment successful

### 📅 Phase 2: Major Framework Migrations (Weeks 2-3)
**Priority: High | Effort: 24-32 hours**

#### 2.1 TypeScript ESLint Migration
```bash
npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@8.38.0 @typescript-eslint/parser@8.38.0
# Review and update ESLint configuration
# Test all linting rules and CI/CD integration
```

#### 2.2 Vitest Ecosystem Migration (Most Complex)
```bash
# Create backup branch first
git checkout -b feature/vitest-v3-migration

# Update all Vitest packages together
npm install --save-dev vitest@3.2.4 @vitest/coverage-v8@3.2.4 @vitest/ui@3.2.4

# Required Configuration Changes:
# - Update vitest.config.ts syntax
# - Review test matcher functions
# - Update CI/CD test commands
# - Validate coverage reporting
```

#### 2.3 ESLint 9 Migration (Highest Complexity)
```bash
# Create dedicated migration branch
git checkout -b feature/eslint-9-flat-config

# Install ESLint 9
npm install --save-dev eslint@9.32.0

# Major Configuration Rewrite Required:
# - Convert .eslintrc.js to eslint.config.js (flat config)
# - Update all plugin configurations
# - Test all existing rules
# - Update CI/CD integration
```

**Phase 2 Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All major frameworks successfully migrated
- ✅ Test suite maintains >90% coverage
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline updated and functional
- ✅ Development team trained on new configurations

### 📅 Phase 3: Enhancement Updates (Week 4)
**Priority: Medium | Effort: 8-12 hours**

#### 3.1 Development Tool Updates
```bash
npm install --save-dev @storybook/addon-a11y@9.0.18 concurrently@9.2.0
```

#### 3.2 Animation Library Update
```bash
cd performance-analysis
npm install framer-motion@12.23.9
# Review animation API changes
# Update affected components
```

#### 3.3 Final Validation and Optimization
- Performance benchmarking
- Bundle size analysis
- Complete regression testing
- Documentation updates

## 📋 Migration Execution Plan

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] **Create backup branch** for current stable state
- [ ] **Document current working configuration**
- [ ] **Run baseline test suite** (all tests passing)
- [ ] **Backup package-lock.json** for quick rollback
- [ ] **Review team availability** for migration period
- [ ] **Prepare rollback procedures** for each phase

### Phase Execution Protocol
1. **Branch Creation:** Each phase gets dedicated feature branch
2. **Incremental Updates:** Never update all packages simultaneously
3. **Testing Gates:** Full test suite must pass between phases
4. **Code Review:** Peer review required for configuration changes
5. **Staged Deployment:** Test in staging before production

### Rollback Strategy
```bash
# Emergency rollback commands for each phase
git checkout main
git checkout package-lock.json  # Restore previous dependencies
npm ci                          # Clean install from lock file
npm test                        # Verify rollback success
```

### Quality Gates
- **Build Time Impact:** < 10% increase acceptable
- **Test Execution Time:** < 15% increase acceptable  
- **Bundle Size:** Monitor for unexpected increases
- **Performance Metrics:** Lighthouse scores maintained
- **Test Coverage:** Maintain >90% throughout migration
