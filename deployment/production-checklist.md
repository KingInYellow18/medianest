## Deployment Execution

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation

1. Provision production infrastructure
2. Configure network security and firewalls
3. Set up SSL certificates and domain configuration
4. Initialize monitoring and logging infrastructure

### Phase 2: Database Deployment

1. Deploy PostgreSQL with backup configuration
2. Deploy Redis with persistence and clustering
3. Run database migrations and validations
4. Configure connection pooling and monitoring

### Phase 3: Application Deployment

1. Deploy backend services with health checks
2. Deploy frontend with CDN configuration
3. Configure reverse proxy and load balancing
4. Validate service communication and security

### Phase 4: Validation & Go-Live

1. Execute smoke tests and health checks
2. Validate monitoring and alerting systems
3. Perform load testing and performance validation
4. Enable production traffic and monitor metrics

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Immediate (First 24 hours)

- [ ] Monitor error rates and response times
- [ ] Validate all health checks passing
- [ ] Confirm backup procedures executing
- [ ] Monitor resource utilization
- [ ] Validate SSL certificates and security
- [ ] Check log aggregation and alerting

### Ongoing (First week)

- [ ] Performance trend analysis
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Capacity planning and scaling validation
- [ ] User feedback and error reporting
- [ ] Documentation and runbook updates
- [ ] Team training and knowledge transfer

## Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback

1. Immediately revert to previous container images
2. Restore database from latest backup if needed
3. Update load balancer to route to stable version
4. Communicate rollback status to stakeholders

### Gradual Rollback

1. Reduce traffic to new version incrementally
2. Monitor metrics during traffic reduction
3. Complete rollback once issues are resolved
4. Analyze root cause and prepare fix

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All services responding with <500ms average response time
- [ ] Error rate below 0.1% for critical endpoints
- [ ] Security scans passing with no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting functioning correctly
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures validated
- [ ] Team comfortable with deployment and rollback procedures
