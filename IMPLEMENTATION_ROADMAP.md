## Critical Decisions Required

### Before Phase 1
1. **Rate Limiting Configuration**: Standardize on 100 req/min per user (per ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. **Service Configuration**: Start with environment variables, plan Docker secrets for production
3. **Real-time Strategy**: Socket.io with polling fallback for WebSocket failures

### Before Phase 2
1. **Circuit Breaker Complexity**: Start with simple retry logic, defer full circuit breakers
2. **Logging Correlation**: Basic request IDs first, full correlation tracking later
3. **Cache Strategy**: Redis only initially, add other layers based on performance needs

### Before Phase 4
1. **APM Tool Selection**: Defer to post-MVP unless performance issues arise
2. **Log Aggregation**: File-based with rotation initially, evaluate ELK later
3. **Database Pooling**: Use Prisma defaults, add PgBouncer if needed

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Plex API changes | High | Version lock, API contract tests |
| WebSocket instability | Medium | Polling fallback, reconnection logic |
| Performance issues | Medium | Caching, query optimization |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Regular audits, dependency updates |

### Schedule Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Integration complexity | High | Early prototyping, incremental integration |
| Testing delays | Medium | Parallel test development |
| Documentation lag | Low | Continuous documentation |
