# Phase 4: Security Audit and Vulnerability Assessment

**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** All features implemented  
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

## Objective

Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and fix vulnerabilities before production deployment, ensuring the application is secure for homelab use.

## Background

Security is critical even for homelab deployments, especially when exposing services to family and friends. This audit ensures we follow security best practices.

## Tasks

### 1. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

- [ ] Run npm audit on all packages
- [ ] Update vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Check for known CVEs
- [ ] Review dependency licenses
- [ ] Document any accepted risks
- [ ] Set up automated scanning

### 2. Authentication Security Review

- [ ] Verify JWT implementation
- [ ] Check token expiration logic
- [ ] Review session management
- [ ] Test token refresh flow
- [ ] Verify logout invalidation
- [ ] Check remember me security

### 3. Authorization Testing

- [ ] Test all RBAC implementations
- [ ] Verify user isolation
- [ ] Check admin-only endpoints
- [ ] Test authorization bypasses
- [ ] Verify resource ownership
- [ ] Test permission escalation

### 4. Input Validation Audit

- [ ] Review all input validation
- [ ] Test for SQL injection
- [ ] Check for XSS vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test file upload security
- [ ] Verify URL validation
- [ ] Check rate limiting

### 5. Data Protection Review

- [ ] Verify encryption implementation
- [ ] Check password handling
- [ ] Review API key storage
- [ ] Test data exposure in logs
- [ ] Check error message leakage
- [ ] Verify HTTPS enforcement

### 6. Security Headers Validation

- [ ] Content Security Policy
- [ ] X-Frame-Options
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options
- [ ] Strict-Transport-Security
- [ ] X-XSS-Protection
- [ ] Referrer-Policy

## Security Checklist

## Security Audit Checklist

### Authentication & Sessions

- [ ] JWT tokens use strong secret
- [ ] Tokens expire appropriately
- [ ] Refresh tokens implemented securely
- [ ] Session fixation prevented
- [ ] Brute force protection active

### Authorization

- [ ] All endpoints check permissions
- [ ] User data properly isolated
- [ ] Admin functions protected
- [ ] No privilege escalation paths
- [ ] Default deny policy

### Input Validation

- [ ] All inputs validated
- [ ] SQL injection prevented
- [ ] XSS protection active
- [ ] Path traversal blocked
- [ ] Command injection prevented

### Cryptography

- [ ] Strong encryption algorithms (AES-256-GCM)
- [ ] Secure random generation
- [ ] Proper key management
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Secure password hashing

### Infrastructure

- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] CORS properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting active
- [ ] Logging doesn't leak secrets
```

## Testing Scripts

```bash
# Dependency audit
npm audit --production
npm outdated

# Security header test
curl -I https://localhost:3000 | grep -E "(Content-Security|X-Frame|X-Content|Strict-Transport)"

# Basic penetration tests
# SQL injection attempt
curl -X POST https://localhost:3000/api/v1/media/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"q": "test\" OR \"1\"=\"1"}'

# XSS attempt
curl -X POST https://localhost:3000/api/v1/media/request \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"title": "<script>alert(1)</script>"}'

# Path traversal attempt
curl https://localhost:3000/api/v1/download/../../../etc/passwd
```

## Remediation Priority

1. **Critical** - Fix immediately
   - Authentication bypasses
   - SQL injection
   - Arbitrary file access
2. **High** - Fix before deployment
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Weak encryption
   - Missing authorization
3. **Medium** - Fix soon after deployment

   - Missing security headers
   - Verbose error messages
   - Weak rate limiting

4. **Low** - Fix in next release
   - Outdated dependencies
   - Missing HSTS
   - Cosmetic issues

## Success Criteria

- [ ] No critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] All high issues resolved
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] Input validation complete
- [ ] Authorization working properly
- [ ] Secrets properly managed

## Notes

- Focus on practical homelab threats
- Don't over-engineer security
- Document accepted risks
- Keep security measures user-friendly
- Plan for security updates
