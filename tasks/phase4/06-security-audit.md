# Phase 4: Security Audit and Vulnerability Assessment

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** All features implemented  
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours  
**Actual Time:** 2 hours  
**Completed:** December 2024

## Objective

Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify and fix vulnerabilities before production deployment, ensuring the application is secure for homelab use.

## Background

Security is critical even for homelab deployments, especially when exposing services to family and friends. This audit ensures we follow security best practices.

## Tasks

### 1. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning

- [x] Run npm audit on all packages
- [x] Update vulnerable dependencies
- [x] Check for known CVEs
- [x] Review dependency licenses
- [x] Document any accepted risks
- [ ] Set up automated scanning (future enhancement)

### 2. Authentication Security Review

- [x] Verify JWT implementation
- [x] Check token expiration logic
- [x] Review session management
- [x] Test token refresh flow
- [x] Verify logout invalidation
- [x] Check remember me security

### 3. Authorization Testing

- [x] Test all RBAC implementations
- [x] Verify user isolation
- [x] Check admin-only endpoints
- [x] Test authorization bypasses
- [x] Verify resource ownership
- [x] Test permission escalation

### 4. Input Validation Audit

- [x] Review all input validation
- [x] Test for SQL injection
- [x] Check for XSS vulnerabilities
- [x] Test file upload security
- [x] Verify URL validation
- [x] Check rate limiting

### 5. Data Protection Review

- [x] Verify encryption implementation
- [x] Check password handling
- [x] Review API key storage
- [x] Test data exposure in logs
- [x] Check error message leakage
- [x] Verify HTTPS enforcement

### 6. Security Headers Validation

- [x] Content Security Policy
- [x] X-Frame-Options
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options
- [x] Strict-Transport-Security
- [x] X-XSS-Protection
- [x] Referrer-Policy

## Security Checklist

## Security Audit Checklist

### Authentication & Sessions

- [x] JWT tokens use strong secret
- [x] Tokens expire appropriately
- [x] Refresh tokens implemented securely
- [x] Session fixation prevented
- [x] Brute force protection active

### Authorization

- [x] All endpoints check permissions
- [x] User data properly isolated
- [x] Admin functions protected
- [x] No privilege escalation paths
- [x] Default deny policy

### Input Validation

- [x] All inputs validated
- [x] SQL injection prevented
- [x] XSS protection active
- [x] Path traversal blocked
- [x] Command injection prevented

### Cryptography

- [x] Strong encryption algorithms (AES-256-GCM)
- [x] Secure random generation
- [x] Proper key management
- [x] No hardcoded secrets
- [x] Secure password hashing

### Infrastructure

- [x] HTTPS enforced (via Nginx reverse proxy)
- [x] Security headers configured
- [x] CORS properly configured
- [x] Rate limiting active
- [x] Logging doesn't leak secrets
```

## Testing Scripts

```bash
# Dependency audit
npm audit --production
npm outdated

# Security header test
curl -I https://localhost:3000 | grep -E "(Content-Security|X-Frame|X-Content|Strict-Transport)"

# Basic penetration tests
# SQL injection attempt
curl -X POST https://localhost:3000/api/v1/media/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"q": "test\" OR \"1\"=\"1"}'

# XSS attempt
curl -X POST https://localhost:3000/api/v1/media/request \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"title": "<script>alert(1)</script>"}'

# Path traversal attempt
curl https://localhost:3000/api/v1/download/../../../etc/passwd
```

## Remediation Priority

1. **Critical** - Fix immediately
   - Authentication bypasses
   - SQL injection
   - Arbitrary file access
2. **High** - Fix before deployment
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Weak encryption
   - Missing authorization
3. **Medium** - Fix soon after deployment

   - Missing security headers
   - Verbose error messages
   - Weak rate limiting

4. **Low** - Fix in next release
   - Outdated dependencies
   - Missing HSTS
   - Cosmetic issues

## Success Criteria

- [x] No critical vulnerabilities
- [x] All high issues resolved
- [x] Security headers present
- [x] Input validation complete
- [x] Authorization working properly
- [x] Secrets properly managed

## Notes

- Focus on practical homelab threats
- Don't over-engineer security
- Document accepted risks
- Keep security measures user-friendly
- Plan for security updates

## Audit Summary

**Security Audit Completed Successfully!** ✅

### Key Findings:
1. **No critical or high vulnerabilities found in production dependencies**
2. **Development-only vulnerabilities documented as acceptable risks**
3. **All security best practices properly implemented:**
   - JWT with 32+ character secrets
   - AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
   - Zod validation on all inputs
   - Prisma ORM preventing SQL injection
   - Rate limiting with Redis
   - Security headers via Helmet
   - RBAC with user isolation

### Acceptable Risks:
- vitest/esbuild vulnerability (development only)
- next-auth cookie vulnerability (low severity, monitoring)

### Security Report:
Detailed security audit report saved to `/SECURITY-AUDIT-REPORT.md`

**The application is secure and ready for homelab deployment!**
