7. **[07-plex-oauth-implementation.md](./07-plex-oauth-implementation.md)** - Plex OAuth Implementation (4 hours)
   - Implement PIN-based OAuth flow
   - Create authentication service
   - Build login UI components

8. **[08-jwt-middleware.md](./08-jwt-middleware.md)** - JWT Middleware and Protected Routes (2 hours)
   - Implement JWT validation
   - Create role-based access control
   - Set up token refresh mechanism

9. **[09-rate-limiting.md](./09-rate-limiting.md)** - Rate Limiting Implementation (2 hours)
   - Configure endpoint-specific limits
   - Implement Redis-based rate limiting
   - Add rate limit headers

10. **[10-error-handling-logging.md](./10-error-handling-logging.md)** - Error Handling and Logging Setup (3 hours)
    - Implement structured logging
    - Create error handling middleware
    - Set up audit logging

### Testing Tasks

11. **[11-unit-testing-setup.md](./11-unit-testing-setup.md)** - Unit Testing Setup and Implementation (4 hours)
    - Configure Jest for backend and frontend
    - Write unit tests for authentication services
    - Achieve 80% code coverage for critical paths

12. **[12-integration-testing.md](./12-integration-testing.md)** - Integration Testing Implementation (3 hours)
    - Set up Testcontainers for database testing
    - Write API endpoint tests
    - Test Plex OAuth flow and JWT validation

## Execution Order

Tasks should be completed in numerical order as they build upon each other:

1. Start with project setup (01) to establish the foundation
2. Set up Docker environment (02) for consistent development
3. Initialize backend (03) and frontend (04) in parallel if multiple developers
4. Complete database schema (05) before moving to Week 2
5. Configure Redis (06) as it's required for authentication
6. Implement Plex OAuth (07) as the primary authentication method
7. Add JWT middleware (08) for API protection
8. Implement rate limiting (09) for security
9. Finish with error handling and logging (10)
10. Set up unit testing framework (11) to test implemented features
11. Add integration tests (12) to verify end-to-end functionality

## Success Criteria

By the end of Phase 1, you should have:

- ✅ Fully configured development environment
- ✅ Working Docker Compose setup
- ✅ Express backend with TypeScript
- ✅ Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- ✅ Redis for sessions and caching
- ✅ Working Plex OAuth authentication
- ✅ JWT-based API authentication
- ✅ Rate limiting on all endpoints
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Unit tests with 80% coverage for critical paths
- ✅ Integration tests for all API endpoints

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Docker containers start without errors
- [ ] Backend health check returns OK
- [ ] Frontend loads in browser
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Redis connection established
- [ ] Plex OAuth flow completes
- [ ] JWT tokens validate correctly
- [ ] Rate limits enforce properly
- [ ] Errors logged with correlation IDs
- [ ] Admin bootstrap login works
- [ ] All unit tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Test suite runs in <30 seconds
- [ ] No flaky tests (failure rate <2%)

## Common Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**: Change ports in docker-compose.yml if needed
2. **Database Connection**: Ensure PostgreSQL is healthy before starting backend
3. **Plex OAuth**: Requires valid Plex account and internet connection
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Run `npm run build` to check for compilation issues
5. **Redis Connection**: Make sure Redis container is running

## Next Phase

After completing Phase 1, proceed to Phase 2: Core Dashboard & Media Features, which builds upon the authentication and infrastructure established here.

## Notes

- Each task includes detailed steps and verification procedures
- Estimated times are for a single developer with moderate experience
- Tasks can be parallelized where dependencies allow
- Always run verification steps before marking a task complete
- Keep the CLAUDE.md file updated with any deviations from the plan
