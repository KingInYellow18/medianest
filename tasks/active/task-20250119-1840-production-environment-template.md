## Task ID

task-20250119-1840-production-environment-template

## Status

- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

- [ ] Critical (P0) - Production issues, security vulnerabilities
- [x] High (P1) - Major features, significant bugs
- [ ] Medium (P2) - Minor features, improvements
- [ ] Low (P3) - Nice-to-have, technical debt

## Description

Create a comprehensive production environment template with all required configuration variables, proper documentation, validation scripts, and secure defaults. This ensures consistent and secure production deployments.

## User Story

As a MediaNest administrator, I want a well-documented environment configuration template so that I can easily set up a production instance with all required settings properly configured.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete .env.production.template created
- [ ] All variables documented with descriptions
- [ ] Required vs optional variables clearly marked
- [ ] Secure defaults provided where applicable
- [ ] Environment validation script created
- [ ] Secret generation helper included
- [ ] Example values for complex configurations

## Technical Requirements

### APIs/Libraries needed:

- dotenv for environment loading
- joi or zod for validation
- crypto for secret generation

### Dependencies:

- All services configured
- Security requirements defined
- Production architecture finalized

### Performance Requirements:

- Validation completes in < 1 second
- No runtime overhead
- Efficient secret generation

## Architecture & Design

- Organized sections (Database, Redis, Auth, Services, etc.)
- Clear naming conventions
- Validation at startup
- Type-safe environment access
- Secret rotation considerations

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Template Creation

- [ ] Audit all environment variables used
- [ ] Create comprehensive template
- [ ] Add detailed documentation
- [ ] Organize by service/component

### Phase 2: Validation Script

- [ ] Create environment validator
- [ ] Check required variables
- [ ] Validate format/patterns
- [ ] Test connectivity where applicable

### Phase 3: Secret Management

- [ ] Update generate-secrets script
- [ ] Add production-specific secrets
- [ ] Document rotation procedures
- [ ] Create secret validation

### Phase 4: Documentation

- [ ] Create setup guide
- [ ] Document each variable
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section
- [ ] Include security best practices

## Files to Create/Modify

- [ ] .env.production.template - Main template file
- [ ] scripts/validate-env.js - Environment validation script
- [ ] scripts/generate-secrets.js - Update for production secrets
- [ ] docs/environment-variables.md - Detailed documentation
- [ ] backend/src/config/env.validation.ts - Runtime validation
- [ ] frontend/.env.production - Frontend production variables

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Test with minimal configuration
- [ ] Test with full configuration
- [ ] Test validation error cases
- [ ] Test secret generation
- [ ] Test in Docker environment
- [ ] Verify no secrets in logs

## Security Considerations

- No default secrets in template
- Secure secret generation
- Proper file permissions (.env)
- Environment variable encryption
- Documentation of sensitive vars
- Rotation procedures defined

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Variable reference guide
- [ ] Security best practices
- [ ] Common configurations
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Migration from development

## Notes & Context

This is critical for production deployments. Every deployment will use this template, so it must be complete and well-documented. Consider creating different templates for different deployment scenarios (minimal, full-featured, etc.).
