# Archive Planning Files

## Task ID

task-20250119-1422-archive-planning-files

## Status

- [x] Completed

## Priority

P2 - Medium (Code Organization)

## Description

Move initial planning and blueprint files to the archive directory. These files were used for initial project planning and are now superseded by current documentation. They should be preserved for historical reference but removed from the main directory.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Move `medianest_blueprint.md` to `docs/archive/planning/`
- [x] Move `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` to `docs/archive/planning/`
- [x] Move `ARCHITECTURE_REPORT.md` to `docs/archive/planning/`
- [x] Verify files are accessible in new location
- [x] Ensure no active references to these files exist in current documentation
- [x] Update any documentation that references these files with new paths or current equivalents

## Technical Requirements

- Use `mv` command to relocate files
- Preserve file contents and metadata
- Check for and update any internal links or references
- Verify git tracking follows the moved files
- Consider if any content should be integrated into current documentation before archiving

## Files to Modify/Create

- Move: `medianest_blueprint.md` → `docs/archive/planning/medianest_blueprint.md`
- Move: `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` → `docs/archive/planning/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`
- Move: `ARCHITECTURE_REPORT.md` → `docs/archive/planning/ARCHITECTURE_REPORT.md`
- Potentially update: Any files that reference these documents

## Testing Strategy

- Verify files exist in new location with correct content
- Check that original locations are empty
- Test that any documentation links still work or are updated
- Confirm git history is preserved
- Ensure current ARCHITECTURE.md contains all relevant information

## Dependencies

- Requires: task-20250119-1420-create-archive-directory-structure (must create archive directories first)

## Related Tasks

- Depends on: Create archive directory structure
- Related: Other archive migration tasks

## Estimated Effort

15 minutes

## Progress Log

- 2025-01-19 14:22: Task created based on CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md analysis
- 2025-01-19: Task completed
  - Moved all three planning files to docs/archive/planning/
  - Updated reference in docs/README.md to point to archived location
  - Verified all files successfully relocated with content preserved

## Notes

The ARCHITECTURE_REPORT.md is specifically noted as being superseded by ARCHITECTURE.md. Before archiving, verify that all important information has been migrated to the current architecture documentation.
