## Description

ServiceCard component tests were failing due to issues with date-fns mock and test expectations. This was resolved by updating the date-fns mock implementation and fixing the formatDistanceToNow test assertion to match the expected behavior.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ServiceCard component tests pass without date-fns mock errors
- [x] formatDistanceToNow test assertion works correctly
- [x] All 6 ServiceCard tests executing successfully
- [x] Date formatting in dashboard works properly

## Technical Requirements

- **Component**: ServiceCard with date formatting
- **Dependencies**: date-fns library for time formatting
- **Tests**: 6 test cases covering component functionality
- **Mocking**: Proper date-fns mock configuration

## Files Modified

- **Updated**: `frontend/src/components/dashboard/__tests__/ServiceCard.test.tsx`
- **Fixed**: date-fns mock implementation
- **Corrected**: formatDistanceToNow test assertions

## Testing Results

✅ All 6 ServiceCard tests passing
✅ date-fns mock working correctly
✅ formatDistanceToNow assertions fixed
✅ Dashboard service status display functional

- **2025-01-19 21:09**: Date-fns mock and assertions already fixed - marked as completed

## Resolution
