## Status

- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Documentation
- [x] Complete

## Priority

P2 - Medium (Code Organization)

## Description

Relocate test-related documentation files to their proper locations in the docs/ directory structure. Move permanent test architecture documentation to docs/ and remove temporary test progress files that are no longer needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Move `test_architecture.md` to `docs/TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [x] Remove `testing_progress.md` (temporary guide no longer needed)
- [x] Verify test architecture documentation is accessible in new location
- [x] Update any references to the moved test architecture file
- [x] Ensure no broken links in documentation

## Technical Requirements

- Move test architecture to permanent docs location
- Remove temporary files that served their purpose
- Update internal documentation links
- Preserve git history for moved files
- Verify test documentation is comprehensive and current

## Files to Modify/Create

- Move: `test_architecture.md` â†’ `docs/TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Remove: `testing_progress.md`
- Potentially update: Any files that reference test documentation

## Testing Strategy

- Verify test architecture file exists in new location with correct content
- Confirm original file locations are cleaned up
- Test that documentation links work correctly
- Ensure test architecture documentation is up-to-date
- Verify removal of temporary files doesn't break anything

## Dependencies

- Requires: task-20250119-1420-create-archive-directory-structure (archive structure should exist)

## Related Tasks

## Estimated Effort

## Progress Log

- 2025-01-19 14:24: Task created based on CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md analysis
- 2025-01-19: Task completed
  - Successfully moved test_architecture.md to docs/TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md
  - Removed temporary testing_progress.md file
  - Updated reference in scripts/fix-tests.sh to point to new location
  - Verified all files moved successfully and no broken references remain

## Notes

The test_architecture.md file contains valuable permanent information that should be in the docs/ directory for easy reference. The testing_progress.md file was a temporary guide that has served its purpose and can be safely removed now that tests are properly implemented.
