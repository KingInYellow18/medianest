# Archive Technical Debt Analysis Files

## Task ID

task-20250119-1421-archive-technical-debt-analysis-files

## Status

- [x] Not Started
- [x] In Progress
- [x] Code Review
- [x] Testing
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Ready to Start
- [x] Completed

## Priority

P2 - Medium (Code Organization)

## Description

Move completed technical debt analysis files to the archive directory. These files documented issues that have now been resolved and should be preserved for historical reference but removed from the main project directory to reduce clutter.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Move `CODE_DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md` to `docs/archive/technical-debt/`
- [x] Move `TECHNICAL_DEBT_AUDIT_REPORT.md` to `docs/archive/technical-debt/`
- [x] Verify files are accessible in new location
- [x] Ensure no active references to these files exist in current documentation (only references are in CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md as part of the cleanup plan)
- [x] Update any documentation that references these files with new paths (no updates needed)

## Technical Requirements

- Use `mv` command to relocate files
- Preserve file contents and metadata
- Update any internal links or references to these files
- Verify git tracking follows the moved files

## Files to Modify/Create

- Move: `CODE_DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md` → `docs/archive/technical-debt/CODE_DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md`
- Move: `TECHNICAL_DEBT_AUDIT_REPORT.md` → `docs/archive/technical-debt/TECHNICAL_DEBT_AUDIT_REPORT.md`
- Potentially update: Any files that reference these documents

## Testing Strategy

- Verify files exist in new location
- Check that original locations are empty
- Test that any documentation links still work
- Confirm git history is preserved

## Dependencies

- Requires: task-20250119-1420-create-archive-directory-structure (must create archive directories first)

## Related Tasks

- Depends on: Create archive directory structure
- Related: Other archive migration tasks

## Estimated Effort

10 minutes

## Progress Log

- 2025-01-19 14:21: Task created based on CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md analysis
- 2025-07-19 02:40: Completed - Moved CODE_DUPLICATION_ANALYSIS.md and TECHNICAL_DEBT_AUDIT_REPORT.md to docs/archive/technical-debt/

## Notes

These files contain valuable historical analysis that helped improve the codebase. They should be preserved but moved out of the main directory since the issues they documented have been resolved.
