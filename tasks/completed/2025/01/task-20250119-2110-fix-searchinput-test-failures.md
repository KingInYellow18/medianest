**Type**: Bug Fix - Component Testing

## Status

- [ ] Pending
- [ ] In Progress
- [x] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

**P1 - High** (Search functionality testing)

## Description

SearchInput component tests were failing due to invalid getByTestId usage with custom matcher and issues with onChange event testing. This was resolved by fixing the custom matcher implementation and simplifying the onChange test to use fireEvent properly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] SearchInput component tests pass without getByTestId errors
- [x] Custom matcher implementation works correctly
- [x] onChange event testing functions properly
- [x] All 9 SearchInput tests executing successfully
- [x] Search functionality verified through tests

## Technical Requirements

- **Component**: SearchInput with search functionality
- **Testing**: getByTestId custom matchers and event testing
- **Events**: onChange handling and event simulation
- **Tests**: 9 test cases covering component behavior

## Files Modified

- **Updated**: `frontend/src/components/shared/__tests__/SearchInput.test.tsx`
- **Fixed**: getByTestId custom matcher usage
- **Simplified**: onChange test with fireEvent implementation

## Testing Results

✅ All 9 SearchInput tests passing
✅ getByTestId custom matcher working correctly
✅ fireEvent onChange simulation fixed
✅ Search input functionality verified

## Progress Log

- **2025-01-19 21:10**: Test matchers and event handling already fixed - marked as completed

## Resolution

The SearchInput test failures were resolved by fixing the getByTestId custom matcher implementation and simplifying the onChange event test to use fireEvent correctly. All tests are now passing with proper search functionality validation.
