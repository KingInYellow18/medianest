## Status

- [x] Not Started
- [x] In Progress
- [x] Code Review
- [x] Testing
- [x] Documentation
- [x] Ready to Start
- [x] Completed

## Priority

P2 - Medium (Code Organization)

## Description

Create a structured archive directory system to store historical documentation files that are no longer actively used but should be preserved for reference. This implements the recommendations from CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md to organize the project's documentation better.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create `docs/archive/` directory structure
- [x] Create subdirectories: `technical-debt/`, `planning/`, `phases/`
- [x] Verify directory structure is accessible and properly organized
- [x] Update .gitignore if needed to ensure archive directories are tracked (not needed, directories are tracked)

## Technical Requirements

- Create directory structure in the docs/ folder
- Follow the pattern recommended in CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md:
  - `docs/archive/technical-debt/` for completed analysis files
  - `docs/archive/planning/` for initial planning documents
  - `docs/archive/phases/` for completed phase documentation

## Files to Modify/Create

- Create: `docs/archive/technical-debt/`
- Create: `docs/archive/planning/`
- Create: `docs/archive/phases/`
- Potentially modify: `.gitignore` (if needed)

## Testing Strategy

- Verify directories are created successfully
- Ensure proper permissions and git tracking
- Test that files can be moved into archive directories

## Dependencies

- None (foundational task)

## Related Tasks

- Depends on: None
- Blocks: All other cleanup tasks (002-005)
- Related: All subsequent archive migration tasks

## Estimated Effort

15 minutes

## Progress Log

- 2025-01-19 14:20: Task created based on CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md analysis
- 2025-07-19 02:40: Completed - Created archive directory structure at docs/archive/ with subdirectories for technical-debt, planning, and phases

## Notes

This is the foundational task that enables all other cleanup activities. Must be completed before any files can be archived.
