# Task: Fix Security Environment Variables

**Task ID**: task-20250119-2122-fix-security-environment-variables  
**Created**: 2025-01-19 21:22  
**Updated**: 2025-01-19 21:22

## Status

- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Complete

**Priority**: P1 (High) - Security audit failing

## Description

Fix security audit test failures related to environment variables not meeting security requirements. The test is expecting ENCRYPTION_KEY to be at least 32 characters but it's only 15 characters.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All security environment variables meet minimum length requirements
- [ ] ENCRYPTION_KEY is at least 32 characters (for AES-256)
- [ ] Security audit tests pass
- [ ] Environment configuration is secure by default
- [ ] Update .env.example with proper security guidance

## Technical Requirements

### Files to Modify

- `.env.example` - Update with secure default values
- `scripts/generate-secrets.js` - Ensure proper key generation
- `backend/tests/security-audit.test.ts` - Verify expectations match reality

### Security Requirements

- **ENCRYPTION_KEY**: Minimum 32 characters for AES-256 encryption
- **NEXTAUTH_SECRET**: Minimum 32 characters
- **JWT_SECRET**: Minimum 32 characters
- All sensitive keys should be cryptographically secure random strings

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Run security audit tests to verify compliance
- [ ] Test encryption functionality with proper key lengths
- [ ] Verify generate-secrets script produces valid keys
- [ ] Check all environment variable validations

## Progress Log

**2025-01-19 21:22** - Task created based on security audit test failures

## Related Tasks

- **Blocks**: Security audit completion
- **Blocked by**: None
- **Related**: Production configuration tasks

## Notes

Security audit is failing because environment variables don't meet security standards. This needs to be fixed before production deployment.
