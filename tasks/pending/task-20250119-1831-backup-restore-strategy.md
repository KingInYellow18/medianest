## Status

- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

- [x] Critical (P0) - Production issues, security vulnerabilities
- [ ] High (P1) - Major features, significant bugs
- [ ] Medium (P2) - Minor features, improvements
- [ ] Low (P3) - Nice-to-have, technical debt

## Description

Implement a comprehensive backup and restore strategy for MediaNest data, including PostgreSQL database backups, Redis persistence, uploaded files, and configuration data. This ensures data can be recovered in case of hardware failure, data corruption, or accidental deletion.

## User Story

As a MediaNest administrator, I want automated backups of all critical data so that I can restore the system to a working state if anything goes wrong.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated daily PostgreSQL backups implemented
- [ ] Redis persistence configured with periodic snapshots
- [ ] Uploaded media files backup strategy defined
- [ ] Configuration and secrets backup process documented
- [ ] Restore process tested and documented
- [ ] Backup retention policy implemented (30 days)
- [ ] Backup monitoring and alerting configured

## Technical Requirements

### APIs/Libraries needed:

- pg_dump for PostgreSQL backups
- Redis RDB/AOF persistence
- rsync or similar for file backups
- Docker volume backup tools

### Dependencies:

- Sufficient storage for backup retention
- Docker volumes properly configured
- Backup storage location (local or cloud)

### Performance Requirements:

- Backups complete within 30 minutes
- Minimal impact on running services
- Restore time < 1 hour for full system

## Architecture & Design

- Use pg_dump for logical PostgreSQL backups
- Configure Redis persistence with RDB snapshots
- Implement incremental file backups for media
- Store backups in separate volume/location
- Encrypt sensitive backup data

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Backup

- [ ] Create PostgreSQL backup script using pg_dump
- [ ] Implement backup rotation (keep 30 days)
- [ ] Set up cron job for daily backups
- [ ] Test backup integrity

### Phase 2: Redis Persistence

- [ ] Configure Redis RDB persistence
- [ ] Set appropriate save intervals
- [ ] Implement Redis backup script
- [ ] Test Redis restore process

### Phase 3: File Backup

- [ ] Identify all directories needing backup
- [ ] Implement file backup script
- [ ] Configure incremental backups
- [ ] Test file restoration

### Phase 4: Restore Procedures

- [ ] Create restore script for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Create restore script for Redis
- [ ] Create restore script for files
- [ ] Document complete restore process

## Files to Create/Modify

- [ ] infrastructure/backup/backup.sh - Main backup orchestration script
- [ ] infrastructure/backup/restore.sh - Restore orchestration script
- [ ] infrastructure/backup/postgres-backup.sh - PostgreSQL backup script
- [ ] infrastructure/backup/redis-backup.sh - Redis backup script
- [ ] infrastructure/backup/files-backup.sh - File backup script
- [ ] docker-compose.prod.yml - Add backup volumes and configurations
- [ ] docs/backup-restore-guide.md - Complete documentation

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Test full backup process end-to-end
- [ ] Perform test restore to verify backups
- [ ] Test partial restore scenarios
- [ ] Verify backup integrity checks
- [ ] Test backup monitoring alerts
- [ ] Document recovery time objectives (RTO)

## Security Considerations

- Encrypt backup files at rest
- Secure backup storage location
- Restrict access to backup scripts
- Sanitize any sensitive data in backups
- Regular backup access audits
- Test backups don't expose secrets

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Backup strategy overview
- [ ] Step-by-step restore procedures
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Backup schedule documentation
- [ ] Disaster recovery runbook

## Related Tasks

- Depends on: task-20250119-1110-docker-production-setup
- Blocks: task-20250119-1850-final-deployment-checklist
- Related to: task-20250119-1835-production-deployment-scripts

## Notes & Context

Critical for production data safety. Consider both local backups for quick recovery and potential cloud backups for disaster recovery. The 30-day retention should be configurable based on storage constraints.
