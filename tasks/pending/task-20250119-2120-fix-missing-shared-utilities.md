# Task: Fix Missing Shared Utilities (crypto.ts and validation.ts)

**Task ID**: task-20250119-2120-fix-missing-shared-utilities  
**Created**: 2025-01-19 21:20  
**Updated**: 2025-01-19 21:20

## Status

- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Complete

**Priority**: P0 (Critical) - Tests are failing due to missing files

## Description

Fix missing crypto.ts and validation.ts files in the shared package that are preventing tests from running. These utility files are being imported by test files but don't exist in the filesystem.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `shared/src/utils/crypto.ts` with required encryption utilities
- [ ] Create `shared/src/utils/validation.ts` with common validation functions
- [ ] Export new utilities from `shared/src/utils/index.ts`
- [ ] All tests in `shared/src/utils/__tests__/` pass successfully
- [ ] Functions are properly typed with TypeScript

## Technical Requirements

### Files to Create

- `shared/src/utils/crypto.ts` - Common cryptographic utilities
- `shared/src/utils/validation.ts` - Shared validation functions

### Expected Functions

**crypto.ts**:

- Hash functions
- Encryption/decryption utilities
- Secure random generation
- Key derivation functions

**validation.ts**:

- Email validation
- URL validation
- Common input sanitization
- Schema validation helpers

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Ensure `crypto.test.ts` passes with new implementation
- [ ] Ensure `validation.test.ts` passes with new implementation
- [ ] Verify no other tests are broken by changes
- [ ] Run full test suite to confirm compatibility

## Progress Log

**2025-01-19 21:20** - Task created based on test failure analysis

## Related Tasks

- **Blocks**: All testing tasks requiring shared utilities
- **Blocked by**: None
- **Related**: task-20250119-2102-implement-shared-crypto-validation-utilities.md

## Notes

This is a critical blocker for the entire test suite. The missing files are preventing proper test execution across the project.
