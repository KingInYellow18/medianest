# Task: Rate Limiting Production Configuration

## Task ID

task-20250119-1841-rate-limiting-production-config

## Status

- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

- [ ] Critical (P0) - Production issues, security vulnerabilities
- [ ] High (P1) - Major features, significant bugs
- [x] Medium (P2) - Minor features, improvements
- [ ] Low (P3) - Nice-to-have, technical debt

## Description

Configure and optimize rate limiting for production environment, including API endpoints, authentication attempts, YouTube downloads, and service-specific limits. This ensures fair usage and protects against abuse while maintaining good user experience.

## User Story

As a MediaNest administrator, I want properly configured rate limits so that the system remains responsive for all users and is protected from abuse or accidental overuse.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Production rate limits configured for all endpoints
- [ ] IP-based rate limiting implemented
- [ ] User-based rate limiting active
- [ ] Service-specific limits configured
- [ ] Rate limit headers returned in responses
- [ ] Monitoring for rate limit violations
- [ ] Graceful error messages for rate-limited requests

## Technical Requirements

### APIs/Libraries needed:

- Redis for distributed rate limiting
- Express-rate-limit (already implemented)
- Custom Lua scripts for complex limits

### Dependencies:

- Redis cluster configured
- User authentication working
- Monitoring system ready

### Performance Requirements:

- Rate limit checks < 5ms
- Minimal memory overhead
- No impact on normal usage
- Scalable to 100+ users

## Architecture & Design

- Tiered rate limiting (IP → User → Endpoint)
- Different limits for authenticated vs anonymous
- Service-specific buckets
- Sliding window algorithm
- Distributed rate limiting via Redis

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Endpoint Configuration

- [ ] Audit all API endpoints
- [ ] Define appropriate limits per endpoint
- [ ] Configure rate limit middleware
- [ ] Test limit enforcement

### Phase 2: Service-Specific Limits

- [ ] YouTube download limits (5/hour)
- [ ] Media request limits (20/day)
- [ ] Authentication attempt limits (5/15min)
- [ ] WebSocket connection limits

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- [ ] Implement IP allowlisting
- [ ] Add user tier support
- [ ] Create admin override capability
- [ ] Add burst allowance

### Phase 4: Monitoring

- [ ] Add rate limit metrics
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Set up alerts for violations
- [ ] Generate usage reports

## Files to Create/Modify

- [ ] backend/src/middleware/rateLimiter.ts - Update with production config
- [ ] backend/src/config/rateLimits.ts - Production limit definitions

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Load test each endpoint
- [ ] Test distributed limiting
- [ ] Verify error responses
- [ ] Test limit reset timing
- [ ] Performance impact testing
- [ ] Multi-user scenario testing

## Security Considerations

- Prevent rate limit bypass attempts
- Log suspicious patterns
- Implement CAPTCHA for repeated violations
- IP-based blocking for severe abuse
- Regular limit review and adjustment

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Rate limit reference table
- [ ] User communication guide
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Configuration guide
- [ ] Best practices

## Notes & Context

Production limits should be more restrictive than development but still allow normal usage patterns. Consider implementing a grace period for first-time violations. The limits should be easily adjustable based on actual usage patterns.
