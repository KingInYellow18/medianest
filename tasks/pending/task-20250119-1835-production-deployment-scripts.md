# Task: Production Deployment Scripts

## Task ID

task-20250119-1835-production-deployment-scripts

## Status

- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

- [ ] Critical (P0) - Production issues, security vulnerabilities
- [x] High (P1) - Major features, significant bugs
- [ ] Medium (P2) - Minor features, improvements
- [ ] Low (P3) - Nice-to-have, technical debt

## Description

Create automated deployment scripts for MediaNest that handle the complete deployment process including pre-flight checks, container deployment, health verification, and rollback capabilities. These scripts will ensure consistent and reliable deployments.

## User Story

As a MediaNest administrator, I want a simple, automated deployment process so that I can deploy updates safely and roll back quickly if issues arise.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] One-command deployment script created
- [ ] Pre-deployment health checks implemented
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment process
- [ ] Automatic rollback on failure
- [ ] Deployment logs and notifications
- [ ] Environment validation before deployment
- [ ] Post-deployment verification automated

## Technical Requirements

### APIs/Libraries needed:

- Docker Compose v2 for orchestration
- Bash scripting for automation
- curl for health checks
- jq for JSON parsing

### Dependencies:

- Docker production setup completed
- SSL certificates configured
- Production environment variables set

### Performance Requirements:

- Deployment completes in < 5 minutes
- Health checks timeout in 30 seconds
- Minimal downtime (< 10 seconds)

## Architecture & Design

- Main deploy.sh script orchestrating deployment
- Modular scripts for different deployment phases
- Health check endpoints for verification
- Version tagging for rollback capability
- Blue-green deployment approach where possible

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Deployment Script

- [ ] Create main deploy.sh script
- [ ] Implement environment validation
- [ ] Add Docker image pull/build logic
- [ ] Create deployment configuration

### Phase 2: Health Checks

- [ ] Implement pre-deployment checks
- [ ] Create service health validators
- [ ] Add database migration checks
- [ ] Implement timeout handling

### Phase 3: Rollback Mechanism

- [ ] Tag deployments with versions
- [ ] Create rollback script
- [ ] Implement automatic rollback triggers
- [ ] Test rollback scenarios

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Notifications

- [ ] Add deployment logging
- [ ] Implement success/failure notifications
- [ ] Create deployment status dashboard
- [ ] Add metrics collection

## Files to Create/Modify

- [ ] scripts/deploy.sh - Main deployment orchestrator
- [ ] scripts/deploy/validate-env.sh - Environment validation
- [ ] scripts/deploy/health-check.sh - Service health checks
- [ ] scripts/deploy/rollback.sh - Rollback functionality
- [ ] scripts/deploy/notify.sh - Notification system
- [ ] scripts/deploy/config.sh - Deployment configuration
- [ ] docs/deployment-guide.md - Deployment documentation

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Test deployment on staging environment
- [ ] Simulate deployment failures
- [ ] Test rollback procedures
- [ ] Verify zero-downtime deployment
- [ ] Test with various error scenarios
- [ ] Load test during deployment

## Security Considerations

- Validate environment variables
- Secure storage of deployment credentials
- Audit deployment actions
- Restrict deployment script access
- Validate Docker images before deployment
- Check for security updates

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Deployment process overview
- [ ] Script usage documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Rollback procedures
- [ ] Emergency response runbook

## Notes & Context

This automation is crucial for reliable deployments and quick recovery from issues. Consider implementing a staging environment test as part of the deployment pipeline. The scripts should be idempotent and handle partial failures gracefully.
