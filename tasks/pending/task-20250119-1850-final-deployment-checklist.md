## Related Tasks

- Depends on: All Phase 5 tasks
- Blocks: Production launch
- Related to: All previous tasks

## Notes & Context

This is the final gate before production launch. Every item must be verified and signed off. The checklist should be reusable for future deployments. Consider having a second person verify critical items. Document lessons learned for future reference.
