# Task: Configure MCP Servers for MediaNest

## Task ID

task-20250119-1045-configure-mcp-servers

## Status

- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

- [ ] Critical (P0) - Production issues, security vulnerabilities
- [x] High (P1) - Major features, significant bugs
- [ ] Medium (P2) - Minor features, improvements
- [ ] Low (P3) - Nice-to-have, technical debt

## Description

Set up and configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for the MediaNest project to enable:

- Context7 for documentation retrieval
- OpenMemory for cross-project knowledge persistence
- Knowledge Graph for project-specific entity relationships
- Perplexity for research and best practices

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All MCP servers are accessible via `/mcp` command
- [ ] Context7 can retrieve documentation for project dependencies
- [ ] OpenMemory can store and retrieve coding patterns
- [ ] Knowledge Graph properly maps MediaNest architecture
- [ ] Perplexity integration works for technical research

## Technical Requirements

### MCP Server Setup:

- Context7 MCP server configuration
- OpenMemory MCP server configuration
- Knowledge Graph MCP server configuration
- Perplexity MCP server configuration

### Dependencies:

- MCP protocol support in development environment
- API keys/credentials for each service
- Network connectivity to MCP servers

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Verify MCP Infrastructure

- [ ] Check MCP server availability with `/mcp`
- [ ] Document any missing servers or connectivity issues

### Phase 2: Initialize Knowledge Systems

- [ ] Create initial Knowledge Graph entities for MediaNest architecture
- [ ] Store MediaNest patterns and conventions in OpenMemory
- [ ] Test Context7 queries for key libraries (Next.js, Prisma, etc.)

### Phase 3: Documentation

- [ ] Update CLAUDE_CUSTOM.md with server status
- [ ] Document any workarounds for unavailable servers
- [ ] Create usage examples for each MCP server

## Files to Create/Modify

- [ ] .mcp.json - MCP server configuration (if needed)
- [ ] tasks/MCP_SETUP_GUIDE.md - Setup documentation
- [ ] CLAUDE_CUSTOM.md - Update with server status

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Test each MCP server individually
- [ ] Verify data persistence in memory systems
- [ ] Test failover behavior when servers unavailable
- [ ] Document response times and performance

## Notes & Context

This is a foundational task for establishing the MCP workflow system in MediaNest.
The goal is to ensure all AI coding sessions can leverage the full MCP server
ecosystem for enhanced context, memory, and research capabilities.
