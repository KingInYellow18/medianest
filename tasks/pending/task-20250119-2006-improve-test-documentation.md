## Priority

P2 - Important for team productivity and onboarding

## Description

Enhance test documentation to make it easier for developers to write and maintain tests. Create comprehensive guides, examples, and best practices specific to the MediaNest codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Update TESTING.md with current test structure and patterns
- [ ] Create test writing guide with MediaNest-specific examples
- [ ] Document MSW mock patterns and handlers
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common test issues
- [ ] Add inline documentation to complex test utilities
- [ ] Create quick reference for test commands
- [ ] Document test database setup and management
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines for tests

## Technical Requirements

- Markdown documentation
- Code examples from actual tests
- Diagrams for test architecture
- Command reference sheets

## Files to Modify/Create

- `TESTING.md` - Update with current state
- `docs/WRITING_TESTS.md` - Comprehensive test writing guide
- `docs/TEST_PATTERNS.md` - Common patterns and anti-patterns
- `docs/MSW_GUIDE.md` - MSW mock service worker guide
- `docs/TEST_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common issues and solutions
- `backend/tests/README.md` - Backend-specific test guide
- `frontend/tests/README.md` - Frontend-specific test guide

## Testing Strategy

- Have another developer follow the guides
- Ensure examples actually work
- Keep documentation in sync with code

## Dependencies

- Requires understanding of current test patterns
- Should incorporate lessons learned from test fixes

## Notes

Current test documentation is good but could be more specific to MediaNest patterns. Developers need clear examples of how to test Plex integration, WebSocket events, and our specific architectures.
