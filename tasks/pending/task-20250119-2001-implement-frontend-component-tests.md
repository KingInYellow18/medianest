# Task: Implement Missing Frontend Component Tests

## Task ID

task-20250119-2001

## Status

- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

P1 - Core UI components need test coverage

## Description

Implement tests for the 11 frontend components that currently have empty test files. These are placeholder files for components that need proper test coverage to ensure UI reliability and prevent regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement tests for PlexBrowser component (authentication, library display)
- [ ] Implement tests for PlexSearch component (search functionality, debouncing)
- [ ] Implement tests for DownloadQueue component (queue display, status updates)
- [ ] Implement tests for URLSubmissionForm component (validation, rate limiting)
- [ ] Implement tests for CollectionProgress component (progress tracking)
- [ ] Implement remaining empty test files with meaningful tests
- [ ] Each component should have at least 3-5 meaningful tests
- [ ] Tests should cover user interactions, error states, and data updates

## Technical Requirements

- React Testing Library for component testing
- MSW for mocking API calls
- Vitest for test runner
- Follow existing test patterns in working component tests

## Files to Modify/Create

Empty test files to implement:

- `frontend/src/components/plex/__tests__/PlexBrowser.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/plex/__tests__/PlexSearch.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/youtube/__tests__/DownloadQueue.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/youtube/__tests__/URLSubmissionForm.test.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/youtube/__tests__/CollectionProgress.test.tsx`
- Other empty test files identified during implementation

## Testing Strategy

- Test user interactions (clicks, form submissions)
- Test component rendering with different props
- Test error states and loading states
- Test integration with hooks (useWebSocket, useServiceStatus)
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Dependencies

- Requires understanding of component functionality
- May need to examine component implementation first

## Related Tasks

- Depends on: Coverage baseline task (to prioritize which components)
- Related to: Frontend performance optimization

## Progress Log

- 2025-01-19 20:01 - Task created based on test suite review

## Notes

Currently 11 frontend test files have 0 tests. These represent significant gaps in UI test coverage. Focus on high-value user interactions and critical paths first.
