## Status

- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

- [ ] Critical (P0) - Production issues, security vulnerabilities

- [ ] Medium (P2) - Minor features, improvements
- [ ] Low (P3) - Nice-to-have, technical debt

## Description

Implement centralized logging and monitoring for MediaNest to enable proper observability in production. This includes aggregating logs from all services, setting up metrics collection, creating monitoring dashboards, and configuring alerts for critical issues.

## User Story

As a MediaNest administrator, I want centralized logging and monitoring so that I can quickly identify issues, track system performance, and receive alerts when problems occur.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Centralized log aggregation implemented
- [ ] Application metrics collection configured
- [ ] System metrics (CPU, memory, disk) monitored
- [ ] Custom dashboards created for key metrics
- [ ] Alert rules configured for critical issues
- [ ] Log retention policy implemented (30 days)
- [ ] Performance baseline established

## Technical Requirements

### APIs/Libraries needed:

- Grafana Loki for log aggregation
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- Alertmanager for notifications
- Node Exporter for system metrics

### Dependencies:

- Docker infrastructure running
- Application logging properly configured
- Network connectivity between services

### Performance Requirements:

- Log ingestion lag < 5 seconds
- Dashboard refresh < 2 seconds
- Minimal overhead (< 5% CPU/memory)
- 30-day data retention

## Architecture & Design

- Grafana Loki for log aggregation (lightweight)
- Prometheus for time-series metrics
- Grafana for unified dashboards
- Promtail for log shipping
- Application instrumentation with Prometheus client
- Docker logging driver configuration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Log Aggregation

- [ ] Deploy Loki and Promtail
- [ ] Configure Docker log drivers
- [ ] Set up log parsing rules
- [ ] Test log aggregation

### Phase 2: Metrics Collection

- [ ] Deploy Prometheus
- [ ] Add application metrics endpoints
- [ ] Configure Node Exporter
- [ ] Set up metric scraping

### Phase 3: Visualization

- [ ] Deploy Grafana
- [ ] Create system dashboard
- [ ] Create application dashboard
- [ ] Create user activity dashboard

### Phase 4: Alerting

- [ ] Configure Alertmanager
- [ ] Define alert rules
- [ ] Set up notification channels
- [ ] Test alert scenarios

## Files to Create/Modify

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Test log aggregation from all services
- [ ] Verify metrics accuracy
- [ ] Test dashboard functionality
- [ ] Trigger and verify alerts
- [ ] Load test monitoring overhead
- [ ] Test data retention policies

## Security Considerations

- Secure Grafana with authentication
- Restrict metrics endpoints access
- Sanitize logs of sensitive data
- Encrypt metrics in transit
- Regular security updates
- Access control for dashboards

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Monitoring architecture overview
- [ ] Dashboard usage guide
- [ ] Alert response procedures
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Metrics reference

- Depends on: task-20250119-1110-docker-production-setup
- Blocks: task-20250119-1850-final-deployment-checklist
- Related to: task-20250119-1845-health-check-implementation

## Notes & Context

Start with a lightweight stack suitable for homelab use. Grafana Loki is preferred over ELK stack due to lower resource requirements. Consider adding application performance monitoring (APM) in the future. Ensure sensitive data is not logged.
