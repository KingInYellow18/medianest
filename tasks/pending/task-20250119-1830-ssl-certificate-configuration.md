# Task: SSL Certificate Configuration

## Task ID

task-20250119-1830-ssl-certificate-configuration

## Status

- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

- [x] Critical (P0) - Production issues, security vulnerabilities
- [ ] High (P1) - Major features, significant bugs
- [ ] Medium (P2) - Minor features, improvements
- [ ] Low (P3) - Nice-to-have, technical debt

## Description

Implement SSL/TLS certificate configuration for secure HTTPS access to MediaNest. This includes setting up Let's Encrypt for automatic certificate generation and renewal, configuring nginx for proper SSL termination, and ensuring all traffic is encrypted.

## User Story

As a MediaNest user, I want to access the application securely over HTTPS so that my authentication credentials and personal data are protected during transmission.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Let's Encrypt integration configured for automatic certificate generation
- [ ] Nginx configured with proper SSL/TLS settings (TLS 1.2+, strong ciphers)
- [ ] HTTP to HTTPS redirect implemented
- [ ] Certificate auto-renewal process tested and working
- [ ] SSL security headers configured (HSTS, etc.)
- [ ] A+ rating on SSL Labs test

## Technical Requirements

### APIs/Libraries needed:

- Certbot (Let's Encrypt client)
- OpenSSL for certificate management
- Nginx SSL module

### Dependencies:

- Domain name configured and pointing to server
- Port 80 and 443 accessible from internet
- Docker production setup completed (task-20250119-1110)

### Performance Requirements:

- SSL handshake time < 100ms
- No noticeable latency increase
- Support for HTTP/2

## Architecture & Design

- Use Certbot in standalone mode or nginx plugin
- Store certificates in Docker volume for persistence
- Configure nginx as reverse proxy with SSL termination
- Implement security best practices (OCSP stapling, session caching)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Certificate Generation

- [ ] Install Certbot in Docker container
- [ ] Configure Let's Encrypt account
- [ ] Generate initial certificates
- [ ] Test certificate validity

### Phase 2: Nginx Configuration

- [ ] Update nginx.conf with SSL configuration
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- [ ] Configure SSL session caching

### Phase 3: Auto-Renewal

- [ ] Set up cron job for certificate renewal
- [ ] Configure renewal hooks for nginx reload
- [ ] Test renewal process
- [ ] Set up monitoring for certificate expiry

## Files to Create/Modify

- [ ] infrastructure/nginx/nginx.prod.conf - Production nginx config with SSL
- [ ] infrastructure/scripts/setup-ssl.sh - SSL setup automation script
- [ ] infrastructure/docker/certbot/Dockerfile - Certbot container if needed
- [ ] docker-compose.prod.yml - Update with SSL volumes and configuration

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Test certificate generation process
- [ ] Verify HTTPS access works correctly
- [ ] Test HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- [ ] Run SSL Labs test for security rating
- [ ] Test certificate renewal process
- [ ] Verify all services work over HTTPS

## Security Considerations

- Use strong TLS configuration (TLS 1.2+)
- Implement proper cipher suites
- Enable HSTS with includeSubdomains
- Configure OCSP stapling
- Protect private keys with proper permissions
- Regular security header validation

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] SSL setup guide for new deployments
- [ ] Certificate renewal troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Security configuration documentation
- [ ] Domain configuration requirements

## Progress Log

- 2025-01-19 18:30 - Task created

## Related Tasks

- Depends on: task-20250119-1110-docker-production-setup
- Blocks: task-20250119-1835-production-deployment-scripts
- Related to: task-20250119-1840-production-environment-template

## Notes & Context

This is critical for production deployment security. Without HTTPS, user credentials and data would be transmitted in plain text. Consider using Cloudflare as an alternative if Let's Encrypt has issues.
