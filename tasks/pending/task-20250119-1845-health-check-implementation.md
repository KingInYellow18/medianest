# Task: Health Check Implementation

## Task ID

task-20250119-1845-health-check-implementation

## Status

- [x] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

- [ ] Critical (P0) - Production issues, security vulnerabilities
- [x] High (P1) - Major features, significant bugs
- [ ] Medium (P2) - Minor features, improvements
- [ ] Low (P3) - Nice-to-have, technical debt

## Description

Implement comprehensive health check endpoints for MediaNest that verify the status of all critical components including database connections, Redis availability, external service integrations, and system resources. These health checks will be used by monitoring systems and deployment scripts.

## User Story

As a MediaNest administrator, I want detailed health check endpoints so that I can monitor system status, automate deployments safely, and quickly identify which components are having issues.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Basic health endpoint returns overall status
- [ ] Detailed health endpoint shows component status
- [ ] Database connectivity checked
- [ ] Redis connectivity checked
- [ ] External service status verified
- [ ] Response time SLAs validated
- [ ] Docker health check compatible
- [ ] Status page UI implemented

## Technical Requirements

### APIs/Libraries needed:

- Express middleware for health checks
- System information library (systeminformation)
- Async health check orchestration

### Dependencies:

- All services integrated
- Monitoring system ready
- Database and Redis running

### Performance Requirements:

- Basic health check < 100ms
- Detailed health check < 1 second
- No impact on normal operations
- Cached results where appropriate

## Architecture & Design

- Layered health checks (quick vs detailed)
- Standardized response format
- Component-specific health indicators
- Graceful degradation reporting
- Circuit breaker integration

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Health Check

- [ ] Create /health endpoint
- [ ] Implement basic alive check
- [ ] Add version information
- [ ] Configure for load balancers

### Phase 2: Component Health Checks

- [ ] Database connection check
- [ ] Redis connection check
- [ ] Disk space verification
- [ ] Memory usage check
- [ ] External service checks

### Phase 3: Detailed Health Endpoint

- [ ] Create /health/details endpoint
- [ ] Aggregate all component checks
- [ ] Add response time metrics
- [ ] Include dependency versions

### Phase 4: Status Page

- [ ] Create public status page UI
- [ ] Real-time status updates
- [ ] Historical uptime display
- [ ] Service-specific indicators

## Files to Create/Modify

- [ ] backend/src/controllers/health.controller.ts - Health check endpoints
- [ ] backend/src/services/health.service.ts - Health check logic
- [ ] backend/src/utils/healthCheckers.ts - Component checkers
- [ ] frontend/src/app/status/page.tsx - Status page UI
- [ ] frontend/src/components/status/ServiceHealth.tsx - Health components
- [ ] shared/src/types/health.ts - Health check types

## Testing Strategy

- [ ] Test with all services up
- [ ] Test degraded scenarios
- [ ] Test complete failures
- [ ] Verify timeout handling
- [ ] Load test health endpoints
- [ ] Test caching behavior

## Security Considerations

- Public endpoints reveal minimal info
- Detailed endpoint requires auth
- No sensitive data in responses
- Rate limit health checks
- Log suspicious patterns

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Health check endpoint reference
- [ ] Response format documentation
- [ ] Integration guide for monitoring
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] SLA definitions

## Notes & Context

Health checks are critical for automated deployments and monitoring. The basic health check should be very fast for frequent polling. Consider implementing a /ready endpoint separately from /health for Docker Compose health checks and monitoring systems.
