# Archive Completed Phase Task Directories

## Task ID

task-20250119-1423-archive-completed-phase-task-directories

## Status

- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Code Review
- [ ] Testing
- [ ] Documentation
- [x] Ready to Start

## Priority

P2 - Medium (Code Organization)

## Description

Archive the legacy phase-based task organization directories (phase0/ through phase5/) that contain 34 completed phase documentation files. The project has migrated to a new MCP-based task workflow, making these phase directories obsolete for active work but valuable for historical reference.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Move entire `tasks/phase0/` through `tasks/phase5/` directories to `docs/archive/phases/`
- [ ] Preserve all task files and their organization within each phase
- [ ] Verify the current MCP-based task workflow directories remain intact (`active/`, `pending/`, `completed/`, etc.)
- [ ] Update task documentation to reflect the archive of legacy phase system
- [ ] Ensure no active references to phase directories exist in current workflow

## Technical Requirements

- Move legacy phase directories while preserving structure
- Keep current MCP workflow directories in place
- Update task system documentation to reflect changes
- Preserve git history for all moved files
- Verify task naming conventions and file integrity

## Files to Modify/Create

- Move: `tasks/phase0/` → `docs/archive/phases/phase0/`
- Move: `tasks/phase1/` → `docs/archive/phases/phase1/`
- Move: `tasks/phase2/` → `docs/archive/phases/phase2/`
- Move: `tasks/phase3/` → `docs/archive/phases/phase3/`
- Move: `tasks/phase4/` → `docs/archive/phases/phase4/`
- Move: `tasks/phase5/` → `docs/archive/phases/phase5/`
- Potentially update: `tasks/README.md`, `tasks/TASK_INDEX.md`

## Testing Strategy

- Verify all phase directories and their contents exist in archive location
- Confirm original phase directories are removed from tasks/
- Check that current MCP workflow directories are unaffected
- Test that task management workflow still functions properly
- Verify git history preservation for moved files

## Dependencies

- Requires: task-20250119-1420-create-archive-directory-structure (must create archive directories first)

## Related Tasks

- Depends on: Create archive directory structure
- Related: Task system documentation updates

## Estimated Effort

20 minutes

## Progress Log

- 2025-01-19 14:23: Task created based on CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md analysis

## Notes

This is a significant organizational change that moves from the legacy phase-based system to the current MCP workflow system. The 34 phase documentation files represent valuable project history but are no longer part of the active task management workflow. Care should be taken to preserve all historical context while cleaning up the active workspace.
