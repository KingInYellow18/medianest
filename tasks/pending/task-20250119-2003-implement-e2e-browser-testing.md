# Task: Implement E2E Browser Testing

## Task ID

task-20250119-2003

## Status

- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

P2 - Important for testing complete user workflows

## Description

Set up end-to-end browser testing using Playwright to test critical user journeys in a real browser environment. This will catch integration issues that unit/integration tests might miss and ensure the complete user experience works correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Install and configure Playwright for E2E testing
- [ ] Implement E2E test for complete Plex authentication flow
- [ ] Implement E2E test for media browsing and requesting
- [ ] Implement E2E test for YouTube download workflow
- [ ] Test mobile responsive layouts
- [ ] Configure tests to run against different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Add E2E tests to CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Keep E2E test execution under 3 minutes

## Technical Requirements

- Playwright test framework
- Test against running application (docker-compose)
- Page object model for maintainability
- Visual regression testing for key pages
- Parallel test execution

## Files to Modify/Create

- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration
- `tests/e2e/auth.spec.ts` - Authentication flow tests
- `tests/e2e/media-request.spec.ts` - Media request workflow
- `tests/e2e/youtube-download.spec.ts` - YouTube download tests
- `tests/e2e/mobile.spec.ts` - Mobile responsiveness tests
- `tests/e2e/pages/` - Page object models
- `package.json` - Add E2E test scripts

## Testing Strategy

- Use page object model for maintainable tests
- Test happy paths for critical user journeys
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Include accessibility testing (a11y)
- Test cross-browser compatibility

## Dependencies

- Requires running application (docker-compose up)
- May need test data seeding

## Related Tasks

- Depends on: Frontend component tests (for stability)
- Related to: Manual testing checklist

## Progress Log

- 2025-01-19 20:03 - Task created based on test suite review

## Notes

Currently no E2E testing exists. Given our 10-20 user target, focus on critical paths only. Playwright is recommended for modern E2E testing with good developer experience and fast execution.
