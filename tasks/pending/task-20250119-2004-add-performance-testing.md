# Task: Add Performance Testing Framework

## Task ID

task-20250119-2004

## Status

- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

P2 - Important for ensuring good user experience with 10-20 concurrent users

## Description

Implement performance testing to ensure the application performs well under expected load (10-20 concurrent users). Focus on API response times, WebSocket performance, and frontend rendering performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Set up k6 or similar tool for API load testing
- [ ] Create performance tests for critical API endpoints
- [ ] Test WebSocket connection handling under load
- [ ] Measure frontend bundle size and load times
- [ ] Establish performance baselines
- [ ] Create performance regression tests
- [ ] Document performance targets and results
- [ ] Add performance tests to CI/CD pipeline (optional)

## Technical Requirements

- k6 for API load testing
- Lighthouse CI for frontend performance
- WebSocket load testing capability
- Performance monitoring in test environment
- Metrics collection and reporting

## Files to Modify/Create

- `tests/performance/k6-config.js` - k6 configuration
- `tests/performance/api-load.js` - API endpoint load tests
- `tests/performance/websocket-load.js` - WebSocket load tests
- `tests/performance/scenarios/` - Test scenarios
- `lighthouse.config.js` - Lighthouse CI configuration
- `scripts/run-performance-tests.sh` - Performance test runner
- `docs/PERFORMANCE_TARGETS.md` - Document targets and baselines

## Testing Strategy

- Simulate 10-20 concurrent users (expected load)
- Test spike to 50 users (2.5x expected)
- Measure response times, error rates, throughput
- Test sustained load for 10 minutes
- Monitor memory and CPU usage

## Dependencies

- Requires deployed test environment
- Need realistic test data

## Related Tasks

- Related to: Backend performance optimization
- Related to: Frontend performance optimization

## Progress Log

- 2025-01-19 20:04 - Task created based on test suite review

## Notes

No performance testing currently exists. For a 10-20 user application, focus on ensuring responsive UX rather than high-scale load testing. Key metrics: API response < 200ms, page load < 3s, WebSocket latency < 100ms.
