# Task: Set Up CI/CD Test Automation

## Task ID

task-20250119-2002

## Status

- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

P1 - Critical for maintaining code quality and preventing regressions

## Description

Implement GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing on every push and pull request. This ensures all code changes are tested before merging and maintains project quality standards.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for test automation
- [ ] Run tests on push to main/development branches
- [ ] Run tests on all pull requests
- [ ] Block PR merges if tests fail
- [ ] Generate and upload coverage reports
- [ ] Add status badges to README
- [ ] Configure test result notifications
- [ ] Ensure workflow completes in under 10 minutes

## Technical Requirements

- GitHub Actions workflow file
- Docker compose for test databases
- Node.js 20.x environment
- Coverage upload to Codecov or similar
- Parallel job execution for speed

## Files to Modify/Create

- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Main test workflow
- `.github/workflows/coverage.yml` - Coverage reporting workflow (optional)
- `README.md` - Add status badges
- `.codecov.yml` - Coverage service configuration (if using Codecov)

## Testing Strategy

- Test workflow locally using act (GitHub Actions emulator)
- Create test PR to verify workflow triggers
- Ensure all test types run (unit, integration, critical paths)
- Verify coverage reports generate and upload

## Dependencies

- Requires GitHub repository access
- May need to set up coverage service account

## Related Tasks

- Depends on: Coverage baseline establishment
- Blocks: Production deployment

## Progress Log

- 2025-01-19 20:02 - Task created based on test suite review

## Notes

The TESTING.md file already includes a sample GitHub Actions configuration. We should adapt this to our specific needs and ensure it works with our monorepo structure.
