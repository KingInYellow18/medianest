# Task: Set Up Test Monitoring and Reporting Dashboard

## Task ID

task-20250119-2007

## Status

- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Completed
- [ ] Blocked

## Priority

P3 - Nice to have for tracking test health over time

## Description

Create a test monitoring dashboard to track test suite health, flaky tests, coverage trends, and execution times over time. This will help identify problematic tests and maintain test suite quality.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Set up test result collection and storage
- [ ] Create dashboard showing test pass/fail rates
- [ ] Track test execution times and identify slow tests
- [ ] Monitor coverage trends over time
- [ ] Identify and flag flaky tests automatically
- [ ] Generate weekly test health reports
- [ ] Set up alerts for test suite degradation
- [ ] Create test performance metrics

## Technical Requirements

- Test result JSON/XML parsing
- Time series data storage for trends
- Dashboard visualization (could be simple HTML)
- Automated report generation
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline

## Files to Modify/Create

- `scripts/collect-test-metrics.js` - Collect test results
- `scripts/generate-test-dashboard.js` - Generate dashboard
- `test-dashboard/` - Dashboard HTML/assets
- `.github/workflows/test-metrics.yml` - Automate collection
- `docs/TEST_METRICS.md` - Document metrics and targets

## Testing Strategy

- Test metric collection accuracy
- Verify dashboard updates correctly
- Ensure trends calculate properly
- Test alert thresholds

## Dependencies

- Requires CI/CD pipeline setup
- Needs test result history

## Related Tasks

- Depends on: CI/CD test automation
- Related to: Coverage baseline task

## Progress Log

- 2025-01-19 20:07 - Task created based on test suite review

## Notes

This is a nice-to-have enhancement that becomes more valuable as the project grows. For now, basic coverage reporting may be sufficient, but this would help maintain long-term test suite health.
