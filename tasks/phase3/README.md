# Phase 3: Feature Implementation Tasks

This directory contains detailed implementation tasks for Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12) of the MediaNest project. Each task file provides comprehensive guidance for implementing specific features.

## Overview

Phase 3 focuses on building the user-facing features of MediaNest, implementing the UI components that interact with the backend services established in Phase 2.

## Task Organization

### Week 9: Dashboard Implementation

2. **[02-service-status-cards.md](02-service-status-cards.md)** - Individual service status cards with health indicators
3. **[03-realtime-status-updates.md](03-realtime-status-updates.md)** - WebSocket integration for live service status updates

### Week 10: Media Request System
4. **[04-media-search-interface.md](04-media-search-interface.md)** - Search interface with Overseerr API integration
5. **[05-media-request-submission.md](05-media-request-submission.md)** - Request submission flow with season selection
6. **[06-request-history-view.md](06-request-history-view.md)** - User request tracking with real-time updates

### Week 11: Plex Library Browser
7. **[07-plex-library-browser.md](07-plex-library-browser.md)** - Browse Plex libraries with filtering and pagination
8. **[08-plex-collection-browser.md](08-plex-collection-browser.md)** - Collection browsing and management interface
9. **[09-plex-search-functionality.md](09-plex-search-functionality.md)** - Advanced search across Plex content

### Week 12: YouTube Download Manager
10. **[10-youtube-url-submission.md](10-youtube-url-submission.md)** - URL submission interface with validation
11. **[11-download-queue-visualization.md](11-download-queue-visualization.md)** - Real-time download progress tracking
12. **[12-plex-collection-creation.md](12-plex-collection-creation.md)** - Automatic Plex collection creation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Prerequisites
- Phase 2 backend services must be complete and tested
- Development environment configured with all dependencies
- API endpoints documented and accessible
- Test data available for development

### General Approach
1. Read through the entire task file before starting implementation
2. Set up any required types and interfaces first
3. Build components incrementally, testing as you go
4. Implement real-time features after static functionality works
5. Add error handling and loading states
6. Write tests for critical functionality
7. Ensure mobile responsiveness

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **UI Library**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query)
- **Real-time**: Socket.io client
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Testing**: Vitest and React Testing Library

### Key Patterns
- **Data Fetching**: Use React Query hooks for all API calls
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket subscriptions with automatic cleanup
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with recovery options
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and progress indicators
- **Form Validation**: Client-side validation with Zod schemas
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies

## Testing Requirements

Each task includes specific testing requirements, but general guidelines include:

1. **Component Testing**
   - Render without errors
   - Handle loading and error states
   - User interactions work correctly
   - Accessibility standards met

2. **Integration Testing**
   - API calls succeed with valid data
   - Error responses handled gracefully
   - Real-time updates apply correctly
   - Authentication flows work

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Pages load within 3 seconds
   - No memory leaks with real-time connections
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Efficient re-renders

## Acceptance Criteria

Phase 3 is complete when:

1. ✅ All dashboard components render with live data
2. ✅ Media search and request flow works end-to-end
3. ✅ Users can browse their Plex library
4. ✅ YouTube downloads queue and process successfully
5. ✅ All features work on mobile devices
6. ✅ Real-time updates function reliably
7. ✅ Error states are handled gracefully
8. ✅ Core functionality has test coverage
9. ✅ Performance targets are met
10. ✅ Accessibility standards are followed

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 3:
1. Review all implemented features with stakeholders
2. Conduct user acceptance testing
3. Fix any identified issues
4. Prepare for Phase 4 (Polish & Optimization)
5. Document any technical debt for future resolution
