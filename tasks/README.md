# MediaNest Task Management

This directory contains task files for the MediaNest project using two organizational systems:

## 🆕 MCP Workflow Organization (Current)

Following the CLAUDE_CUSTOM.md workflow, tasks are now organized by status:

### Directory Structure

```
tasks/
├── active/           # Currently in progress tasks
├── pending/          # Waiting to be started (13 tasks)
├── completed/        # Finished tasks (35 tasks)
│   └── 2025/01/      # Organized by year/month
├── blocked/          # Tasks with external dependencies
├── templates/        # Task templates
│   ├── bug-fix-template.md
│   ├── feature-template.md
│   └── refactor-template.md
└── backlog/          # Future tasks (1 task)
```

### Quick Stats

- **Completed**: 35 tasks (Phases 0-3 + partial Phase 4)
- **Pending**: 13 tasks (Phase 4 & 5)
- **Backlog**: 1 task (Post-MVP)
- **Total**: 49 tasks

### Key Documents

- **TASK_INDEX.md** - Complete index of all reorganized tasks
- **MCP_WORKFLOW_README.md** - Detailed workflow instructions
- **PHASE_TASK_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md** - Migration documentation

## 📁 Phase-Based Organization (Legacy)

The original phase directories (phase0-5) are preserved for reference:

### Phase Status Overview

- **Phase 0: Project Setup** ✅ Complete (6/6 tasks)
- **Phase 1: Core Foundation** ✅ Complete (9/9 tasks)
- **Phase 2: External Service Integration** ✅ Complete (5/5 tasks)
- **Phase 3: Feature Implementation** ✅ Complete (14/15 tasks)
- **Phase 4: Production Readiness** 🚧 In Progress (1/7 tasks)
- **Phase 5: Launch Preparation** 📋 Not Started (0/6 tasks)

## Current Focus

### High Priority Tasks (Phase 4 - Production Readiness)

1. **API Endpoint Testing** - Comprehensive API test coverage
2. **Manual Testing Checklist** - Real-world testing scenarios
3. **Frontend Performance** - Next.js optimizations
4. **Backend Performance** - API and database tuning
5. **Security Audit** - Vulnerability assessment
6. **Production Configuration** - Secure deployment setup

### Getting Started with a Task

```bash
# 1. View pending tasks
ls tasks/pending/

# 2. Choose a task and move to active
mv tasks/pending/task-20250119-1100-api-endpoint-testing.md tasks/active/

# 3. Work on the task, updating progress log

# 4. When complete, archive it
mv tasks/active/task-20250119-1100-api-endpoint-testing.md tasks/completed/2025/01/
```

## Task Workflow Process

1. **Select Task**: Choose from `pending/` based on priority
2. **Activate**: Move to `active/` when starting work
3. **Track Progress**: Update task file with progress logs
4. **Complete**: Move to `completed/YYYY/MM/` when done
5. **Knowledge Capture**: Update Knowledge Graph with learnings

## Key Achievements to Date

### Infrastructure ✅

- Monorepo with TypeScript, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Next.js 14 frontend, Express backend
- WebSocket real-time updates

### Features ✅

- Plex OAuth authentication
- Service status dashboard
- Media search & request system
- Plex library browsing
- YouTube downloader with queue
- Real-time status updates

### Remaining Work

- Comprehensive testing (6 tasks)
- Performance & security (included above)
- Documentation (3 tasks)
- Production deployment (3 tasks)

## Success Metrics

The MVP is complete when:

1. ✅ Users can authenticate with Plex
2. ✅ Service dashboard shows real-time status
3. ✅ Users can browse Plex libraries
4. ✅ Users can request media via Overseerr
5. ✅ Users can download YouTube content
6. ✅ All services gracefully degrade
7. 📋 Deployed with Docker in production
8. 📋 Automated backups running
9. 📋 Documentation complete
10. 📋 5-10 beta users successfully using the system

## Time Estimates

- **Phase 4 Testing & Optimization**: ~2 weeks
- **Phase 5 Documentation & Deployment**: ~1 week
- **Total to Production MVP**: ~3 weeks

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check task status
ls tasks/active/        # Current work
ls tasks/pending/       # Next up
ls tasks/completed/     # Done

# Search for tasks
grep -r "performance" tasks/
grep -r "security" tasks/

# Task templates
ls tasks/templates/
```

## Notes

- Each task file contains detailed implementation steps
- Tasks can be worked on in parallel where dependencies allow
- Focus on MVP functionality - avoid scope creep
- Test continuously as you implement
- Keep the homelab scale in mind (10-20 users max)
