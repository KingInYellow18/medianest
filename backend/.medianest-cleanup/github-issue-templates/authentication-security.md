# Authentication & Security Issues

## Issue 1: Implement Webhook Signature Verification

**File**: `src/routes/v1/webhooks.ts:16`  
**Type**: security  
**Priority**: critical  
**Labels**: security, webhooks, authentication

### Description

Currently, Overseerr webhook endpoints are accepting requests without signature verification, creating a security vulnerability where malicious actors could trigger fake webhook events.

**Current Code:**

```typescript
// TODO: Implement webhook signature verification
// const signature = req.headers['x-overseerr-signature'];
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for Overseerr webhooks
- [ ] Add webhook secret configuration to environment variables
- [ ] Validate incoming webhook signatures against expected values
- [ ] Return 401 Unauthorized for invalid signatures
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for signature validation
- [ ] Document webhook signature verification in API documentation
- [ ] Add logging for failed signature validations

### Technical Implementation

- Use crypto library for HMAC-SHA256 verification
- Add middleware for webhook signature validation
- Configure webhook secrets in environment variables
- Implement rate limiting for webhook endpoints

### Security Impact

**Risk**: High - Unverified webhooks could allow injection of malicious data
**Mitigation**: Critical security control for webhook integrity

## Issue 2: Implement Security Audit Database Logging

**File**: `src/middleware/security-audit.ts:160`  
**Type**: enhancement  
**Priority**: critical  
**Labels**: security, audit, database, logging

### Description

Security audit events are currently only logged to files. Database logging is required for:

- Centralized audit trail
- Real-time security monitoring
- Compliance reporting
- Advanced analytics and alerting

**Current Code:**

```typescript
private async logToDatabase(_events: SecurityEvent[]): Promise<void> {
  // TODO: Implement database logging
}
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create security_audit_logs database table with proper schema
- [ ] Implement database insertion for security events
- [ ] Add event categorization and risk scoring
- [ ] Implement event deduplication logic
- [ ] Add database connection error handling
- [ ] Create indexes for efficient querying
- [ ] Add data retention policies
- [ ] Implement bulk insert for performance
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for database logging
- [ ] Create migration scripts for database schema

### Technical Implementation

- Design audit log table schema
- Use Prisma ORM for database operations
- Implement batch processing for high-volume events
- Add connection pooling considerations
- Create proper indexes for search performance

### Compliance Impact

Required for security audit trails and regulatory compliance

## Issue 3: Enhanced Security Audit Features

**File**: `src/middleware/security-audit.ts` (multiple TODOs in .fixed file)  
**Type**: enhancement  
**Priority**: high  
**Labels**: security, audit, search, analytics

### Description

The security audit system needs additional features for comprehensive security monitoring:

- Log search functionality
- Security statistics and reporting
- Advanced filtering and analytics

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implement audit log search API with filtering
- [ ] Add security event statistics dashboard
- [ ] Create risk-based event categorization
- [ ] Implement real-time alerting for critical events
- [ ] Add audit log export functionality
- [ ] Create comprehensive security reporting
- [ ] Add user behavior analytics
- [ ] Implement threat detection patterns

### Technical Implementation

- Build search API with ElasticSearch or similar
- Create statistical aggregation queries
- Implement real-time event streaming
- Add configurable alerting rules
