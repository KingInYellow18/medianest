/**
 * ErrorBoundary Test - Final Working Solution for Vitest
 * 
 * This test demonstrates the correct approach for testing React Error Boundaries
 * with Vitest, which has stricter error handling than Jest.
 * 
 * Key approach: We accept that errors will be thrown and caught by the test framework,
 * but we verify that the Error Boundary still renders the correct error UI.
