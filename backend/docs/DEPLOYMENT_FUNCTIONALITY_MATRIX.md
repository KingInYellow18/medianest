**Primary Features:**

1. **Plex Integration** - Media server management
2. **Overseerr Integration** - Media request management
3. **YouTube Downloads** - Content acquisition
4. **Dashboard** - System monitoring and control
5. **Admin Panel** - User and system management
6. **Authentication** - Plex-based OAuth flow

**Technical Stack:**

- Express.js with TypeScript
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Socket.IO for real-time updates
- Bull queues for background jobs

## Test Results Analysis

### E2E Test Failures (8/8 tests failed)

```
‚ùØ üé¨ Complete Media Request Workflow - Expected 200, got 404
‚ùØ üîí Security Testing - Test timed out (30s)
‚ùØ üì± Responsive Testing - Initialization errors
‚ùØ ‚ö° Performance Testing - Test timed out (30s)
‚ùØ üîÑ Error Handling - Test timed out (30s)
‚ùØ üìà Health Check - Database connectivity FAILED
```

**Root Cause:** Infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, Redis) not running or misconfigured.

## Security Assessment

### üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY POSTURE: MIXED

**WORKING Security Features:**

- Helmet.js security headers
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting middleware
- JWT-based authentication structure
- Input validation with Zod
- Error sanitization

**SECURITY CONCERNS:**

- **Database exposure risk**: Failed connections could expose credentials
- **Token validation untested**: Auth middleware exists but unverified
- **Session management unknown**: Redis failures affect session security

## Deployment Viability Matrix

### Stage 1: Development Environment

```
‚ùå BLOCKED - Critical infrastructure dependencies missing
```

### Stage 2: Staging Deployment

```
üö® EXTREMELY HIGH RISK - Would result in total application failure
```

### Stage 3: Production Deployment

```
üõë ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED - Multiple system-critical failures
```

## Critical Blockers for Deployment

### 1. Database Connectivity (CRITICAL)

```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED postgresql://...
Impact: Total application unusability
Required: PostgreSQL instance setup and configuration
```

### 2. Redis Connectivity (CRITICAL)

```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:6379
Impact: Sessions, caching, real-time features broken
Required: Redis instance setup
```

### 3. Basic Server Startup (CRITICAL)

```
Multiple server processes failing to start
Impact: Application completely inaccessible
Required: Infrastructure debugging
```

## Remediation Requirements

### IMMEDIATE (Must Complete Before ANY Deployment)

1. **Database Setup**: Configure PostgreSQL with proper schema
2. **Redis Setup**: Configure Redis instance for sessions/caching
3. **Environment Configuration**: Verify all required environment variables
4. **Basic Server Testing**: Confirm application starts and responds

### BEFORE STAGING DEPLOYMENT

1. **Integration Testing**: Verify core user journeys work
2. **Security Validation**: Confirm auth flows and data protection
3. **Performance Baseline**: Establish acceptable response times
4. **Error Handling**: Verify graceful degradation

### BEFORE PRODUCTION

1. **Load Testing**: Confirm performance under realistic load
2. **Security Audit**: Full penetration testing
3. **Backup/Recovery**: Verify data protection strategies
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability stack

## Recommendation

**DO NOT DEPLOY** to any environment until infrastructure dependencies are resolved.

**Priority Actions:**

1. Set up PostgreSQL database
2. Set up Redis instance
3. Configure proper environment variables
4. Verify basic application startup
5. Run integration tests to confirm core functionality

**Timeline Estimate:** 2-4 days minimum for basic infrastructure setup and validation.

## Risk Assessment for Premature Deployment

**Probability of Total System Failure:** 100%  
**User Impact:** Complete inability to use application  
**Data Safety:** Unknown - database connection failures could indicate corruption risk  
**Security Risk:** High - authentication and session management unverified

**VERDICT: DEPLOYMENT PROHIBITED UNTIL INFRASTRUCTURE RESOLVED**
