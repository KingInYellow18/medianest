      securityHeaders: this.getSecurityHeaders(),
      // ... isolated environment
    };
  }

  resetToInitialState() {
    vi.clearAllMocks(); // Aggressive cleanup
  }

  validateInterface() {

```typescript
// Verify no security data leakage
expect(response.body).not.toHaveProperty('secret');
expect(response.body).not.toHaveProperty('token');
expect(response.body).not.toHaveProperty('internalError');
```
