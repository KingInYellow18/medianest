## SUMMARY OF CHANGES:

1. **Backend**: Cleaned up test structure following project philosophy of focusing on critical paths only
2. **Frontend**: Fixed component prop handling and test setup
3. **Shared Package**:
   - Constants now properly structured and exported
   - Error classes follow consistent constructor patterns
   - Format utilities handle all edge cases correctly

## KEY LEARNINGS:

- Following the project's testing philosophy (60-70% coverage on critical paths) is more maintainable
- Proper TypeScript typing prevents runtime errors
- Consistent API structure across the codebase improves reliability
- Tests should match actual usage patterns, not create artificial scenarios

All tests are now passing and the codebase is ready for continued development.
