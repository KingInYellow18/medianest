4. Test_Tasks/fix-shared-constants-implementation.md [HIGH]

   - Constants don't match test expectations
   - API endpoints missing version prefix
   - Service names using wrong case
   - Missing RATE_LIMITS definition

5. Test_Tasks/fix-backend-empty-test-files.md [MEDIUM]
   - ~30+ empty test files causing warnings
   - Recommendation: Remove non-critical test files
   - Keep only critical path tests per project philosophy

EXECUTION DETAILS:

- Backend tests: 17 passed, many empty files
- Frontend tests: 0 passed, 7 failed (all YouTube component tests)
- Shared tests: 0 passed, 44 failed
- Integration tests: 14 passed (simple versions work)

NEXT STEPS:
Address task files in priority order. Critical issues should be resolved before proceeding with lower priority items. The shared package failures are blocking as they affect both frontend and backend.
