# MediaNest End-to-End Testing Suite

## Overview

The MediaNest End-to-End Testing Suite provides comprehensive validation of complete user workflows and business processes through realistic, production-like testing scenarios. This suite validates the system's readiness for production deployment by testing all critical paths and performance characteristics.

## Architecture

### Core Components

   - Analytics and reporting workflows

3. **Performance Load Testing** (`performance-load-testing.ts`)
   - Concurrent user simulation
   - Realistic load patterns (steady, burst, gradual, spike)
   - Network condition simulation (3G, 4G, WiFi)
   - Resource utilization monitoring

4. **Cross-Browser Device Testing** (`cross-browser-device-testing.ts`)
   - Multi-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Device responsiveness (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
   - Progressive Web App feature validation
   - Touch and gesture support testing

5. **Master E2E Orchestrator** (`master-e2e-orchestrator.spec.ts`)
   - Coordinates all testing components
   - Generates comprehensive validation reports
   - Provides production readiness assessment

## Test Categories

### 1. User Journey Testing

**Purpose**: Validate complete user workflows from registration to content management

**Key Journeys**:
- User registration, email verification, and login
- File upload, processing, and organization
- Media management and collection creation
- Search and navigation functionality
- User profile management
- Collaboration and sharing workflows

**Validation Points**:
- UI element accessibility and visibility
- API endpoint responses
- Database state consistency
- Performance metrics
- Accessibility compliance

### 2. Business Process Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure critical business processes function correctly end-to-end

**Key Processes**:
- **Media Lifecycle**: Upload → Processing → Organization → Archival
- **User Permissions**: Role creation → Assignment → Enforcement
- **Backup/Recovery**: Configuration → Execution → Validation
- **System Administration**: Health monitoring → Maintenance → Reporting
- **Content Moderation**: Review → Approval/Rejection → Policy enforcement
- **Analytics**: Data collection → Processing → Report generation

**Validation Points**:
- Business logic correctness
- Data integrity maintenance
- Process completion verification
- Error handling and recovery
- Audit trail creation

### 3. Performance and Load Testing

**Purpose**: Validate system performance under realistic user load

**Load Patterns**:
- **Steady**: Consistent user activity over time
- **Gradual**: Progressive increase in user load
- **Burst**: Sudden spike in concurrent users
- **Spike**: Targeted high-load periods

**User Types**:
- **Casual Users** (70%): Browse, view content, basic interactions
- **Power Users** (25%): Upload, organize, share content actively
- **Admin Users** (5%): System management, user administration

**Performance Metrics**:
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Response times (average, 95th percentile)
- Error rates and failure patterns
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)
- Scalability characteristics

### 4. Cross-Browser and Device Testing

**Purpose**: Ensure compatibility across all supported platforms

**Browser Coverage**:
- **Chrome**: Latest stable, feature-rich testing
- **Firefox**: Standards compliance validation
- **Safari**: WebKit engine compatibility
- **Edge**: Microsoft ecosystem support

**Device Categories**:
- **Desktop**: 1920x1080, 1366x768 resolutions
- **Tablet**: iPad Pro, standard iPad, Android tablets
- **Mobile**: iPhone variants, Android devices (Pixel, Galaxy)

**Feature Validation**:
- Responsive design adaptation
- Touch and gesture support
- Progressive Web App features
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Performance optimization

npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run in headed mode (visible browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Individual Test Categories

```bash
# User journey testing only
npx playwright test --grep "User Journey"
