  - **JWT Mock**: Full JWT lifecycle with token blacklisting
  - **Auth Mock**: Complete authentication workflow mocking

### 3. Test Configuration Overhaul ✅

- **Issue**: Inconsistent test environments and configuration
- **Fix**: Created unified test configuration system
- **Components**:
  - `test-infrastructure-config.ts`: Centralized configuration
  - `docker-compose.test.yml`: Isolated test services
  - `test-runner.sh`: Comprehensive test execution script

### 4. Test Coverage Infrastructure ✅

- **Target**: >70% coverage across all metrics
- **Implementation**:
  - Coverage thresholds enforced in vitest.config.ts
  - Comprehensive unit tests for critical components
  - Integration tests for API endpoints
  - Test reporting and analysis tools
