- **Penetration Testing**: 🔴 Framework exists but broken
- **Security Monitoring**: 🔴 Not functional

### Required for Production Readiness

- ✅ Comprehensive security tests (exist but broken)
- ❌ Functional security test execution (CRITICAL)
- ❌ Automated security validation (CRITICAL)
- ❌ Security incident detection (CRITICAL)

## 📞 NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Priority Actions:

1. **Execute comprehensive security test repair** (This session)
2. **Validate all security tests pass** (This session)
3. **Enable automated security testing** (This session)
4. **Create security monitoring integration** (This session)
