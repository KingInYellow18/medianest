# Git Branch Audit Report - MediaNest Project

**Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Auditor**: Claude Flow Swarm (4-agent coordination)  
**Current Branch**: test  
**Risk Level**: üî¥ HIGH

## Executive Summary

The MediaNest repository contains **17 local branches** with significant organizational issues requiring immediate attention. The primary concerns are branch divergence, naming inconsistencies, and potential content contamination across branches.

### Security Branches
- **security-backup-20250723-183138** - Security backup (2025-07-23)

## Critical Issues Identified

### üî¥ 1. Branch Divergence
- **development** branch is 44 commits ahead of main - major integration risk
- **claude-flow** is 17 commits behind test - sync issues
- **test** branch is 14 commits ahead of remote - unpushed changes

### üî¥ 2. Naming Convention Inconsistencies
- Mixed PR prefixes: `pr-` vs `pr/` (recommend standardizing on `pr/`)
- Claude branch variants: `claude-flow` vs `claude-flowv2`
- No clear naming strategy for experimental branches

### üî¥ 3. Cross-Branch Content Contamination
- Identical `.claude/` command files across multiple branches
- Same file modifications present in main, test, development, and claude-flowv2
- Suggests improper branch isolation and potential merge conflicts

### üî¥ 4. Stale Branch Management
- **roo-commander**: 37 days old, likely obsolete
- **claude-code**: 9 days without updates
- **homelab-test-optimized**: 7 days stale
- Multiple unmerged branches creating maintenance overhead

## Branch Integrity Analysis

### Merge Status
- **3 branches** successfully merged into main
- **14 branches** remain unmerged from main
- High risk of integration conflicts due to divergence

### Tracking Status
- **claude-flow**: Behind test by 17 commits
- **development**: Ahead of main by 44 commits (critical)
- **test**: Ahead of origin by 14 commits (needs push)

### Content Separation Issues
- Cross-contamination in `.claude/` directories
- Workflow files duplicated across branches
- Configuration drift between branches

## Recommendations

### üö® Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Merge Development Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge development
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Standardize PR Naming**
   - Rename `pr-*` branches to `pr/*` format
   - Establish naming convention documentation

3. **Cleanup Stale Branches**
   ```bash
   # Archive or delete obsolete branches
   git branch -d roo-commander  # if fully merged elsewhere
   git push origin --delete roo-commander
   ```

### üîß Medium Priority Actions

4. **Sync Claude Flow Branches**
   ```bash
   git checkout claude-flow
   git rebase test
   ```

5. **Push Outstanding Changes**
   ```bash
   git checkout test
   git push origin test
   ```

6. **Consolidate Experimental Branches**
   - Decide on primary AI development branch
   - Archive unused variants (claude-flowv2 vs claude-flow)

### üìã Long-term Improvements

7. **Establish Branch Strategy**
   - Document branch purposes and lifecycles
   - Implement branch protection rules
   - Set up automated cleanup policies

8. **Implement Branch Governance**
   - Create branch naming conventions
   - Establish merge policies
   - Set up regular branch audits

## Branch Purpose Clarification

| Branch | Purpose | Status | Action Needed |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------|
| main | Production releases | ‚úÖ Active | Merge development |
| development | Integration staging | ‚ö†Ô∏è Diverged | Immediate merge |
| test | Test infrastructure | ‚úÖ Active | Push changes |
| feature/* | New features | ‚úÖ Active | Monitor completion |
| pr/* | Pull request work | ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed | Standardize naming |
| claude-* | AI development | ‚ö†Ô∏è Fragmented | Consolidate |
| security-backup | Emergency backup | ‚ö†Ô∏è Stale | Review necessity |

## Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level**: üî¥ **HIGH**

**Primary Risks**:
1. Integration conflicts from 44-commit divergence
2. Lost work from untracked branch changes  
3. Developer confusion from naming inconsistencies
4. Merge conflicts from cross-branch contamination

**Mitigation Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for critical issues, 1 month for full cleanup

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Weekly branch audits** using automated tooling
2. **Branch protection rules** on main branches
3. **Automated stale branch detection** (30+ days)
4. **Pre-merge validation** for naming conventions
5. **Cross-branch contamination** detection in CI
