            "objective": "Analyze all git branches in medianest repository and merge production-viable code to main branch: FIRST list and analyze all existing branches to understand their purpose, changes, and current state. Review each branch for: code completeness and stability; test coverage and passing status; merge conflicts with main; production readiness criteria; security implications; documentation completeness. Create detailed report of each branch status. THEN for production-ready branches: resolve any merge conflicts intelligently preserving functionality; merge branches in logical order considering dependencies; update CHANGELOG.md with merged features; ensure all tests pass after each merge; maintain clean commit history with meaningful merge messages. For incomplete branches: document what's needed for production readiness; create issues for remaining work; determine if partial features can be safely merged. Generate final report showing what was merged, what was deferred, and why. Ensure main branch remains stable throughout process.",
