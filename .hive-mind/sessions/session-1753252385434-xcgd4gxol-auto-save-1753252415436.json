            "objective": "Conduct comprehensive technical analysis of the existing medianest project codebase, architecture, and current styling implementation. Research and evaluate Tailwind CSS framework capabilities, performance benefits, developer experience improvements, and ecosystem compatibility. Investigate complementary component libraries such as Headless UI, Radix UI, Chakra UI, Mantine, and other modern UI frameworks that could enhance development velocity and maintainability. Perform detailed cost-benefit analysis comparing current styling approach versus potential Tailwind CSS integration, including migration effort estimation, performance impact assessment, bundle size analysis, and long-term maintenance considerations. Generate comprehensive technical documentation including: 1) Current project audit with identified pain points and opportunities, 2) Detailed Tailwind CSS evaluation with pros/cons specific to medianest requirements, 3) Component library comparison matrix with recommendations, 4) Three distinct refactoring approaches (minimal migration, moderate integration, complete overhaul) with effort estimates and risk assessments, 5) Step-by-step implementation roadmap with milestones and rollback strategies, 6) Performance benchmarking predictions and optimization opportunities. Deliver findings as structured markdown documentation for stakeholder review and decision-making.",
