# MERGE TO STAGING - COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUCTIONS

## CRITICAL WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

This document contains precise instructions for merging develop branch to staging. **Follow these instructions EXACTLY** - deviation could result in production deployment failures or data loss.

---

## SECTION 1: Pre-Merge Preparation

### 1.1 Verification Checklist

**MANDATORY - Complete ALL items before proceeding:**

```bash
# Check current branch and status
git status
git branch -v

# Verify you are on develop branch
if [ "$(git branch --show-current)" != "develop" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Must be on develop branch"
    exit 1
fi

# Ensure develop is clean and up-to-date
git fetch origin
git status --porcelain | wc -l  # Should return 0 for clean state
```

**Expected Output:**
- Current branch: `develop`
- Working tree: clean (no uncommitted changes)
- Branch status: up to date with origin/develop

### 1.2 Documentation Verification

**Verify all critical documentation exists:**

```bash
# Check for required deployment documentation
ls -la docs/deployment/
ls -la README_DEPLOYMENT.md
ls -la docs/CONFIGURATION_AUDIT.md
ls -la docs/DOCKER_CONFIGURATION_ANALYSIS.md

# Verify MkDocs configuration
mkdocs build --clean --strict --config-file mkdocs.yml
```

**Expected Files Present:**
- ‚úÖ `docs/deployment/` directory with deployment configurations
- ‚úÖ `README_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Primary deployment guide
- ‚úÖ `docs/CONFIGURATION_AUDIT.md` - Configuration audit results
- ‚úÖ `docs/DOCKER_CONFIGURATION_ANALYSIS.md` - Docker setup analysis
- ‚úÖ `scripts/deployment-automation.sh` - Deployment automation
- ‚úÖ `scripts/generate-secrets.sh` - Secret generation utility

### 1.3 Backup Procedures

**Create comprehensive backup before merge:**

```bash
# Create timestamped backup branch
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
BACKUP_BRANCH="backup/pre-staging-merge-$TIMESTAMP"

git checkout -b $BACKUP_BRANCH
git push -u origin $BACKUP_BRANCH

# Return to develop
git checkout develop

# Create backup of critical files
mkdir -p backups/pre-staging-merge-$TIMESTAMP
cp -r docs/ backups/pre-staging-merge-$TIMESTAMP/
cp -r scripts/ backups/pre-staging-merge-$TIMESTAMP/
cp README_DEPLOYMENT.md backups/pre-staging-merge-$TIMESTAMP/
cp mkdocs*.yml backups/pre-staging-merge-$TIMESTAMP/

echo "Backup completed: $BACKUP_BRANCH"
echo "File backup: backups/pre-staging-merge-$TIMESTAMP/"
```

### 1.4 Team Coordination

**Communication Protocol:**

1. **Notify stakeholders** of impending staging merge
2. **Lock develop branch** to prevent concurrent changes
3. **Coordinate with operations team** for staging environment readiness
4. **Schedule rollback window** (minimum 2 hours)

**Slack/Email Notification Template:**
```
üö® STAGING MERGE INITIATED

Branch: develop ‚Üí staging
Timestamp: $(date)
Backup: backup/pre-staging-merge-$TIMESTAMP
Estimated Duration: 30-60 minutes
Rollback Window: 2 hours

DO NOT MERGE TO DEVELOP DURING THIS PROCESS
```

---

## SECTION 2: Step-by-Step Merge Instructions

### 2.1 Pre-Merge Validation

**Execute comprehensive validation:**

```bash
# Run complete test suite
npm run test:all || {
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Tests failing - ABORT MERGE"
    exit 1
}

# Validate Docker configuration
./validate-docker-setup.sh || {
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Docker validation failed - ABORT MERGE"
    exit 1
}

# Check for security vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level=high || {
    echo "WARNING: Security vulnerabilities detected - Review required"
    read -p "Continue with merge? (y/N): " -n 1 -r
    if [[ ! $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
        exit 1
    fi
}

# Validate MkDocs build
mkdocs build --clean --strict || {
    echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Documentation build failed - ABORT MERGE"
    exit 1
}
```

### 2.2 Execute Merge to Staging

**CRITICAL: Execute these commands in exact order:**

```bash
# Step 1: Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Step 2: Switch to staging branch
git checkout staging
git pull origin staging

# Step 3: Verify staging branch state
echo "Current staging commit:"
git log --oneline -n 5

# Step 4: Execute merge (NO FAST-FORWARD to maintain history)
git merge --no-ff develop -m "chore: merge develop to staging for deployment validation

- Complete documentation overhaul with MkDocs Material
- Enhanced deployment automation and configuration
- Security updates and vulnerability fixes
- Performance optimizations and testing improvements
- Comprehensive Docker configuration analysis

üö® STAGING DEPLOYMENT - REQUIRES VALIDATION BEFORE PRODUCTION

Merged from: develop ($(git rev-parse develop))
Backup: backup/pre-staging-merge-$(date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")

ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code (https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

**Expected Success Output:**
```
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
[List of changed files]
```

### 2.3 Conflict Resolution Strategies

**If merge conflicts occur:**

```bash
# Check conflict status
git status

# For documentation conflicts (common with parallel updates):
# 1. Review conflicted files
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# 2. For each conflicted file:
# Manual resolution required - prioritize develop branch changes for:
# - Configuration files
# - Documentation updates
# - Security improvements

# 3. After resolving conflicts:
git add [resolved-files]
git commit -m "resolve: merge conflicts in staging deployment

Resolved conflicts in:
- [list files]

Prioritized develop branch changes for configuration and security updates."

# 4. Verify resolution
git log --oneline -n 3
```

### 2.4 Push Staging Branch

**Push merged changes to remote:**

```bash
# Push staging branch
git push origin staging

# Verify push success
git log --oneline origin/staging -n 5

# Create merge tag for tracking
MERGE_TAG="staging-merge-$(date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")"
git tag -a $MERGE_TAG -m "Staging merge: develop ‚Üí staging $(date)"
git push origin $MERGE_TAG

echo "Staging merge completed successfully"
echo "Merge tag: $MERGE_TAG"
```

---

## SECTION 3: Post-Merge Verification

### 3.1 Merge Success Verification

**Verify merge integrity:**

```bash
# Check merge commit exists
git log --oneline --merges -n 5

# Verify file changes
git diff HEAD~1 --name-only | head -20

# Confirm all expected files present
CRITICAL_FILES=(
    "README_DEPLOYMENT.md"
    "docs/CONFIGURATION_AUDIT.md"
    "docs/DOCKER_CONFIGURATION_ANALYSIS.md"
    "scripts/deployment-automation.sh"
    "scripts/generate-secrets.sh"
    "mkdocs.yml"
)

for file in "${CRITICAL_FILES[@]}"; do
    if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then
        echo "CRITICAL ERROR: Missing file: $file"
        exit 1
    else
        echo "‚úÖ Verified: $file"
    fi
done
```

### 3.2 Documentation Validation in Staging

**Validate documentation builds correctly:**

```bash
# Clean build test
rm -rf site/
mkdocs build --clean --strict --config-file mkdocs.yml

# Verify critical pages exist
CRITICAL_PAGES=(
    "site/index.html"
    "site/deployment/index.html"
    "site/configuration/index.html"
    "site/docker/index.html"
)

for page in "${CRITICAL_PAGES[@]}"; do
    if [ ! -f "$page" ]; then
        echo "ERROR: Missing documentation page: $page"
    else
        echo "‚úÖ Documentation page exists: $page"
    fi
done

# Test documentation server (optional - for local validation)
# mkdocs serve --config-file mkdocs.yml &
# SERVER_PID=$!
# sleep 5
# curl -f http://localhost:8000 > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Documentation server responding"
# kill $SERVER_PID
```

### 3.3 Configuration Verification

**Validate all configurations are correct:**

```bash
# Check environment configuration
if [ ! -f ".env.production.example" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Missing production environment template"
    exit 1
fi

# Validate Docker configuration
docker-compose -f docker-swarm-stack.yml config > /dev/null || {
    echo "ERROR: Docker Swarm configuration invalid"
    exit 1
}

# Check deployment scripts are executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
ls -la scripts/*.sh | grep "^-rwx"

# Validate secret generation
./scripts/generate-secrets.sh --test || {
    echo "ERROR: Secret generation script failed"
    exit 1
}
```

**Prepare staging environment for deployment:**

```bash
# Set staging environment variables
export DEPLOYMENT_ENV=staging
export MEDIANEST_ENV=staging

# Create staging secrets (if not exists)
if [ ! -f "secrets/staging.env" ]; then
    ./scripts/generate-secrets.sh --env staging
fi

# Backup current staging deployment (if exists)
STAGING_BACKUP_DIR="backups/staging-backup-$(date +"%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")"
mkdir -p $STAGING_BACKUP_DIR

# Copy current staging configurations
cp -r deployment/staging/* $STAGING_BACKUP_DIR/ 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 4.2 Deploy to Staging Environment

**Execute staging deployment:**

```bash
# Method 1: Using deployment automation script
./scripts/deployment-automation.sh --environment staging --validate-only

# Review deployment plan
read -p "Proceed with staging deployment? (y/N): " -n 1 -r
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
    ./scripts/deployment-automation.sh --environment staging --deploy
fi

# Method 2: Manual Docker deployment (if automation fails)
# docker-compose -f deployment/staging/docker-compose.staging.yml up -d
```

**Expected Deployment Success Indicators:**
- ‚úÖ All containers start successfully
- ‚úÖ Database migrations complete
- ‚úÖ Health checks pass
- ‚úÖ Documentation site accessible
- ‚úÖ API endpoints responding

### 4.3 Staging Validation Checklist
