## [Unreleased] - Documentation Audit & Repair

### Fixed

- **Documentation Accuracy**: Removed inflated claims about AI/ML capabilities that don't exist
- **Project Status**: Created honest assessment of actual project state vs documentation claims
- **Build Issues**: Documented extensive TypeScript compilation errors (80+ errors)
- **Test Failures**: Documented failing integration tests (28/30 error handling tests failing)
- **Audit Report Claims**: Removed misleading "Production Ready ✅" and "8.1/10 health score" claims

### Added

- **CHANGELOG.md**: First honest changelog documenting actual project state
- **Real Issue Tracking**: Documented actual build and test failures
- **Accurate Feature List**: Listed features that actually exist vs claimed features
- **Known Issues Section**: Comprehensive list of current problems

### Removed

- **Misleading Audit Reports**: Comprehensive Project Audit claiming "Production Ready"
- **Inflated Claims**: References to non-existent AI/ML features
- **False Metrics**: Unsubstantiated health scores and completion percentages

### Changed

- **README.md**: Updated to reflect actual capabilities and known issues
- **Project Status**: From "Production Ready" to "Development/Repair Phase"

## [1.0.0] - Previous State (No Accurate Change Tracking)

### Note

- **Previous Documentation**: Contained unverified claims about project maturity
- **No Changelog**: This is the first changelog - previous changes were not accurately tracked
- **Audit Claims**: Previous audit reports made inflated claims not supported by actual code state

### Actual State Assessment (January 2025)

MediaNest is a Next.js/Express.js monorepo project for Plex media management with:

**What Actually Works:**

- Basic Express.js backend structure with TypeScript
- Next.js frontend setup with React 19
- Prisma ORM configuration for PostgreSQL
- Docker containerization setup
- ESLint and testing framework configuration
- Basic authentication middleware structure

**Current Issues:**

- **80+ TypeScript compilation errors** preventing successful builds
- **28 out of 30 integration tests failing** in error handling middleware
- **Circuit breaker tests timing out** (concurrency issues)
- **Missing Plex integration configuration** (referenced but not implemented)
- **Inconsistent type definitions** between frontend and backend
- **Database schema issues** with ID type mismatches (string vs number)

**Build Status:** ❌ **NOT BUILDING** due to TypeScript errors
**Test Status:** ❌ **FAILING** (majority of integration tests fail)
**Production Status:** ❌ **NOT PRODUCTION READY**

## Project Repair Priorities

### High Priority (Build Blockers)

1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**: 80+ compilation errors need resolution
2. **Database Schema Consistency**: ID type mismatches (string vs number)
3. **Missing Configuration**: Plex integration config structure
4. **Type Definition Alignment**: Frontend/backend type consistency

### Medium Priority (Test Failures)

1. **Error Handling Middleware**: 28/30 tests failing
2. **Circuit Breaker Timeouts**: Concurrency test issues
3. **Authentication Flow**: Type mismatches in auth controller

### Low Priority (Enhancements)

1. **Documentation Cleanup**: Remove remaining inflated claims
2. **Real Feature Implementation**: Build claimed features that don't exist
3. **Security Hardening**: Once basic functionality works

**Documentation Honesty Policy**: This changelog commits to accurate tracking of changes without inflated claims or unverified metrics. All status claims will be backed by actual code verification and test results.
