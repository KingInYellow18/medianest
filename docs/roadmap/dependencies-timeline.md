**Timeline Impact:** 6-8 week dependency

```mermaid
gantt
    title Performance â†’ AI Dependencies
    dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD

    section Performance Layer
    Redis Caching Implementation    :active, perf1, 2025-05-01, 2025-05-31
    Database Query Optimization     :active, perf2, 2025-05-15, 2025-06-15
    API Response Optimization       :perf3, 2025-05-01, 2025-06-30

    section AI Readiness
    ML Data Pipeline Setup         :ai-prep, after perf2, 30d
    Model Training Infrastructure   :ai-model, after ai-prep, 21d
    Recommendation API             :ai-api, after ai-model, 14d
```

**Why This Dependency Exists:**

- AI features require sub-100ms data access
- ML models need optimized query performance
- Recommendation engine depends on cached user data
- Training pipelines require performant data extraction

**Risk Mitigation:**

- Parallel development of ML models with mock data

#### Dashboard â†’ Enterprise Features

**Criticality:** Medium  
**Timeline Impact:** 4-6 week dependency

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant D as Advanced Dashboard
    participant M as Monitoring Infrastructure
    participant E as Enterprise Features
    participant T as Multi-Tenancy

    D->>M: Real-time monitoring widgets
    M->>E: Health check infrastructure
    E->>T: Per-tenant monitoring
    T->>E: Resource usage dashboards
    E->>D: Enterprise dashboard views
```

**Dependency Rationale:**

- Enterprise features need monitoring infrastructure
- Multi-tenant dashboards build on single-tenant design
- Resource usage visualization requires base dashboard
- Admin interfaces extend user dashboard patterns

```

**Why This Sequence Matters:**

1. **Service Registry** must be stable before plugin registration
2. **API Abstraction** needed for consistent plugin interfaces
3. **Health Monitoring** required for plugin reliability
4. **Configuration Management** essential for plugin settings

**Technical Implementation:**

```typescript
// Service Integration Foundation (Q3 Early)
interface ServiceIntegration {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  capabilities: ServiceCapability[];
  healthEndpoint: string;
  configSchema: JSONSchema;
