## 🎯 STAGING DEPLOYMENT WORKFLOW

### **Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation**
**Estimated Duration:** 24-48 hours

```bash
# 1. Environment Preparation
export STAGING_ENV="staging"
export DEPLOYMENT_ID=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# 2. Critical System Checks
npm run test:critical
npm run build:production:verify
npm run security:scan

# 3. Infrastructure Validation
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml config --quiet
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up --dry-run
```

### **Phase 2: Staged Rollout Protocol**
**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 hours

```bash
# Stage 1: Infrastructure Only (0 users)
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/staging/infrastructure.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/medianest-infrastructure

# Stage 2: Application Deployment (Internal Testing - 5 users)
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/staging/application.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment/medianest-app

# Stage 3: Limited User Access (Beta Group - 50 users)
kubectl patch deployment medianest-app -p '{"spec":{"replicas":2}}'

# Stage 4: Broad User Access (All Authorized - 500 users)
kubectl patch deployment medianest-app -p '{"spec":{"replicas":5}}'
```

### **Phase 3: Validation and Monitoring**
**Estimated Duration:** 2-4 hours

```bash
# Health Validation
curl -f http://staging.medianest.com/health/ready
curl -f http://staging.medianest.com/health/live

# Performance Validation
npm run performance:staging:baseline
npm run load-test:staging:light

# Security Validation
npm run security:staging:validate
npm run auth:flow:verify
```

## 🚨 EMERGENCY ROLLBACK PROCEDURES

### **Immediate Rollback (<60 seconds)**
```bash
# Emergency stop and rollback to previous stable version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/medianest-app --to-revision=1
kubectl get pods -l app=medianest-app --watch

# Verify rollback success
curl -f http://staging.medianest.com/health
kubectl logs -l app=medianest-app --tail=100
```

### **Database Rollback (if required)**
```bash
# Restore database from pre-deployment snapshot
pg_restore --clean --if-exists -d medianest_staging backup_pre_deployment.sql

# Verify data integrity
psql -d medianest_staging -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM critical_tables;"
```

### **Full Environment Reset**
```bash
# Complete environment restoration
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml down
docker system prune -f
git checkout HEAD~1
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml up -d

# Verify environment restoration
npm run health:check:full
