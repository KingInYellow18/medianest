## 🔄 Required Actions Before Merge Execution

### Immediate Requirements:

1. **Fix all CI/CD pipeline failures** - No merges can proceed with failing builds
2. **Resolve merge conflicts** in PR #124 (develop → staging)
3. **Address lint/type checking errors** - Critical for code quality
4. **Fix build failures** - Essential for deployment readiness
5. **Resolve test failures** - Required for stability validation

### Dependency Analysis:

Based on branch relationships, the optimal merge sequence **AFTER** all CI fixes would be:

```
1. PR #126: tests/playwright → develop (Add Playwright tests)
2. PR #124: develop → staging (Docker hardening) - REQUIRES conflict resolution
3. PR #125: develop → main (Phase 1 restoration)
4. PR #123: staging → main (Staging updates)
```

## 🛡️ Merge Safety Protocol

### Pre-Merge Validation (CURRENTLY FAILING):

- [ ] All CI/CD checks pass
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Linting passes
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Security scans clear

### Post-Merge Validation Plan:

Once CI issues are resolved, each merge will include:

- ✅ Immediate build validation
- ✅ Smoke test execution
- ✅ Rollback point creation
- ✅ Health check monitoring

## 📊 Current Repository State

- **Branch**: `staging`
- **Status**: Behind origin/staging by 1 commit
- **Local Changes**: Stashed (`.gitignore`, `CLAUDE.md`)
- **Last Successful Build**: Unknown (all recent CI runs failing)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **WAIT** for review agents to address CI/CD failures
2. **VALIDATE** all PRs pass CI checks before resuming
3. **RESOLVE** merge conflicts in PR #124
4. **EXECUTE** merges in dependency order once validated
5. **MONITOR** post-merge pipeline health

## 🚨 MERGE ORCHESTRATOR STATUS: STANDBY

**No merge operations will be performed until all CI/CD issues are resolved.**
