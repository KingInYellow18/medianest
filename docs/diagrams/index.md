### Mermaid Configuration

Diagrams use Mermaid.js with the following standards:

```yaml
theme: base
themeVariables:
  primaryColor: '#1976d2'
  primaryTextColor: '#ffffff'
  primaryBorderColor: '#0d47a1'
  lineColor: '#666666'
  secondaryColor: '#f5f5f5'
  tertiaryColor: '#e3f2fd'
```

### Color Coding Standards

Consistent color scheme across all diagrams:

- **Client Layer**: `#e1f5fe` (Light Blue)
- **API Layer**: `#e8f5e8` (Light Green)
- **Service Layer**: `#fff3e0` (Light Orange)
- **Data Layer**: `#fce4ec` (Light Pink)
- **External Services**: `#f1f8e9` (Light Green)
