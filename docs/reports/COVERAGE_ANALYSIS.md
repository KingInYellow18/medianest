         },
       },
     },
   });
   ```

3. **Quality Gates Implementation**
   ```bash
   # Add to CI/CD pipeline
   npm run test:coverage -- --reporter=json --reporter=text

   ```

### Test Strategy Improvements

1. **Test-First Development**
   - Write tests before implementing new features
   - Ensure coverage for all business logic
   - Implement test automation in CI/CD

2. **Coverage-Driven Refactoring**
   - Identify untested legacy code
   - Add tests before refactoring
   - Maintain coverage during refactoring

3. **Critical Path Focus**
   - Prioritize business-critical components
   - Ensure 99% coverage for security components
   - Regular coverage audits

The estimated **55 hours of testing effort** across phases 1-3 will provide substantial improvements to code reliability and maintainability.

**Immediate Actions Required:**

1. Fix 6 failing authentication tests (5 hours)
2. Implement Redis service coverage (8 hours)
3. Add media controller tests (6 hours)
4. Cover authentication middleware (4 hours)

**Success Metrics:**

- Phase 1 completion: 80% coverage achieved
- Zero failing tests maintained
- All critical paths covered above 95%
- Production deployment confidence restored
