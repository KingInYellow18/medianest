## 🎯 IMMEDIATE REMEDIATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Recovery (URGENT)

1. **Configure test environment for React components**

   - Set up JSDOM or happy-dom for DOM simulation
   - Configure React Testing Library properly
   - Fix component test imports and setup

2. **Repair API test infrastructure**

   - Fix Plex authentication mocking
   - Configure proper test databases
   - Implement proper request/response mocking

3. **Restore test coverage tracking**
   - Configure coverage collection properly
   - Set minimum coverage thresholds
   - Implement coverage reporting

### Phase 2: Quality Gate Implementation

1. **Implement pre-commit hooks**

   - Block commits with failing tests
   - Require minimum coverage thresholds
   - Automated TypeScript checking

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancement**
   - Add comprehensive test stages
   - Implement quality gates
   - Add performance monitoring
