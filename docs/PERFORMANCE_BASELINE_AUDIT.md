- **Shared package**: Build failed due to TypeScript errors
- **Bundle Sizes**:
  - Shared dist: 932KB
  - Backend dist: 2.9MB
  - Node modules: 1.2GB

## 2. Code Complexity Metrics

### 2.1 Codebase Statistics

```
Total Source Files: 887 (.ts, .js, .tsx, .jsx excluding node_modules)
Total Lines of Code: 152,697 lines
Average File Size: ~172 lines per file
Project Structure: Monorepo with shared, backend, frontend
```

### 2.2 File Distribution Analysis

```
- TypeScript configuration files detected
- Test files distributed across packages
- Built artifacts in dist directories
- Comprehensive ESLint and Prettier configuration
```

### 2.3 Architecture Complexity

- **Multi-package monorepo** structure
- **TypeScript composite project** setup
- **Comprehensive tooling** (ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Playwright)
- **Docker containerization** ready

## 3. Test Execution Performance

### 3.1 Test Performance Metrics

```
Test Suite: Vitest v3.2.4
Total Execution Time: ~6.5 seconds
Test Results: 77 passed, 36 failed (68% pass rate)
Test Coverage: Not measured due to failures
```

### 3.2 Test Failure Analysis

**Shared Package Tests (11 failed):**

- Constants validation tests failing due to missing/incorrect constants definitions
- API endpoints, services, socket events configuration issues

**Backend Integration Tests (25 failed):**

- Database/Prisma integration issues (`prisma2.sessionToken.deleteMany is not a function`)
- Enhanced Plex OAuth flow tests failing
- Session management and authentication test failures

### 3.3 Test Performance Bottlenecks

- Database mock/setup issues causing cascading failures
- Missing test configuration for Prisma client
- Integration test dependencies not properly initialized

## 4. Dependency Impact Assessment

### 4.1 Dependency Health

```
Package Lock Status: ❌ MISSING (lockfile not found)
Audit Status: ❌ CANNOT AUDIT (no lockfile)
Outdated Packages: Multiple packages missing or outdated
Security Vulnerabilities: Cannot assess without lockfile
```

### 4.2 Key Dependency Issues

**Missing Dependencies:**

- Multiple backend packages not installed (@prisma/client, axios, bcrypt, etc.)
- Version mismatches detected in npm outdated output
- Lock file corruption or deletion

**Version Compatibility:**

- `ioredis-mock`: Current 4.7.0, Latest 8.9.0 (major version behind)
- `bcrypt`: Missing but latest is 6.0.0 (current config expects 5.1.1)
- `express-rate-limit`: Missing, latest is 8.1.0 vs configured 7.4.0

### 4.3 Bundle Size Analysis

**node_modules Impact:**

- Total size: 1.2GB (70% of project size)
- Largest dependencies detected:
  - `next/dist`: 153MB
  - `@tabler/icons-react/dist`: 72MB
  - `effect/dist`: 25MB
  - `rxjs/dist`: 9.7MB

## 5. System Resource Analysis

### 5.1 System Performance

```
Available Memory: 22GB free (28GB total)
Disk Space: 33GB available (95GB total, 64% used)
CPU Load: Minimal during testing
System Health: GOOD - Adequate resources available
```

### 5.2 Resource Utilization Patterns

- Memory usage remains stable during builds/tests
- Disk space consumption primarily from node_modules
- No resource constraints detected during analysis

## 6. Performance Baseline Metrics

### 6.1 Current Baselines (Failed State)

```
Build Success Rate: 0% (all builds failing)
Test Success Rate: 68% (77/113 tests passing)
Dependency Health: Poor (missing lockfile)
Code Quality: Moderate (TypeScript errors present)
```

### 6.2 Performance Targets for Improvement

```
Build Success Rate: Target 100%
Test Success Rate: Target 95%+
Build Time: Target <30s for incremental builds
Test Time: Target <10s for unit tests
Bundle Size: Monitor and optimize large dependencies
```

## 7. Critical Performance Issues

### 7.1 Immediate Blockers

1. **TypeScript Compilation Failures** - Prevents any builds from succeeding
2. **Missing Package Lock** - Dependency management compromised
3. **Test Infrastructure Issues** - 32% test failure rate
4. **Database Mock Configuration** - Integration tests failing

### 7.2 Performance Impact Analysis

- **Development Velocity**: Severely impacted by build failures
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Would fail at build stage
- **Code Quality**: Degraded due to TypeScript errors
- **Testing Confidence**: Low due to high failure rate

## 8. Recommendations

### 8.1 Critical Actions Required (P0)

1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**: Resolve 8 compilation errors in shared package
2. **Regenerate Package Lock**: Run `npm install` to create new lockfile
3. **Fix Test Configuration**: Resolve Prisma mock setup issues
4. **Update Dependencies**: Address missing and outdated packages

### 8.2 Performance Optimizations (P1)

1. **Bundle Analysis**: Investigate large dependencies (153MB Next.js)
2. **Test Performance**: Optimize test setup and mocking
3. **Build Optimization**: Implement incremental builds
4. **Dependency Audit**: Regular security and performance audits

### 8.3 Monitoring Setup (P2)

1. **CI Performance Tracking**: Monitor build/test times in pipeline
2. **Bundle Size Monitoring**: Track dependency size growth
3. **Test Performance Metrics**: Monitor test execution times
4. **Code Complexity Tracking**: Regular complexity analysis
