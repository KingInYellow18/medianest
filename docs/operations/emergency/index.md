## ðŸ“‹ Emergency Contact Information

### Escalation Procedures

- **P0 Critical**: System-wide failure, complete service outage
- **P1 High**: Major service degradation, significant user impact
- **P2 Medium**: Minor service issues, limited user impact

### Recovery Team Roles

- **Crisis Coordinator**: Overall recovery strategy and coordination
- **Infrastructure Specialist**: Docker, networking, and container issues
- **Database Specialist**: Data integrity and connectivity issues
- **Security Specialist**: Authentication, authorization, and vulnerability
  response

## ðŸ”§ Emergency Response Procedures

### System Recovery Phases

1. **Foundation Repair** (Dependencies, Database, Configuration)
2. **Validation Systems** (Testing, Code Quality)
3. **Infrastructure Restoration** (Docker, Monitoring)

### Crisis Coordination Hooks

All emergency procedures use Claude Flow coordination:

```bash
# Pre-task coordination
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks pre-task --description "emergency response"

# Progress tracking
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-edit --memory-key "swarm/emergency/progress"

# Completion reporting
npx claude-flow@alpha hooks post-task --task-id "emergency-recovery"
```

## ðŸ“Š Recovery Success Metrics

### Target Recovery Times

- **P0 Critical**: 4-6 hours maximum
- **P1 High**: 2-4 hours maximum
- **P2 Medium**: 1-2 hours maximum

### Historical Performance

- **Last Recovery**: 4.5 hours (62% faster than 12-16 hour estimate)
- **Success Rate**: 85%+ system recovery achieved
- **Coordination Effectiveness**: Multi-agent deployment successful

## ðŸŽ¯ Emergency Validation Checklist

### Pre-Recovery Assessment

- [ ] Identify root cause and impact scope
- [ ] Assess recovery timeline and resource requirements
- [ ] Establish communication channels and coordination
- [ ] Document baseline system state for rollback

### Recovery Execution

- [ ] Execute systematic 3-phase recovery plan
- [ ] Maintain atomic commits for rollback capability
- [ ] Monitor progress via coordination hooks
- [ ] Validate each phase completion before proceeding

### Post-Recovery Validation

- [ ] Verify all critical systems operational (85%+ readiness)
- [ ] Execute end-to-end smoke tests
- [ ] Update emergency documentation with lessons learned
- [ ] Schedule post-incident review and prevention measures

## ðŸ”„ Rollback Procedures

### Emergency Rollback Capability

- **Git State**: All changes committed atomically
- **Dependency Backup**: Package-lock snapshots created
- **Configuration Backup**: Original .env files preserved
- **Docker Images**: Previous states tagged and available

### Rollback Commands

```bash
# 1. Revert to last known good state
git checkout <last-good-commit>

# 2. Restore dependencies
cp package-lock.json.emergency-backup package-lock.json && npm ci

# 3. Restore configuration
cp .env.backup .env && cp .env.staging.backup .env.staging

# 4. Restart services
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
```
