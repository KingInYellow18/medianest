# Network Security Framework - MediaNest

**Classification**: Internal Use  
**Last Updated**: September 8, 2025  
**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Security Level**: Confidential  

## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive network security framework for MediaNest, implementing defense-in-depth network controls, micro-segmentation, and advanced threat protection. The framework addresses current network security strengths while enhancing protection against modern threats.

## Current Network Security Assessment

### Strengths Identified ✅
- **Reverse Proxy**: Traefik providing SSL termination and routing
- **Network Isolation**: No direct external access to backend services
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers implemented
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-backed atomic rate limiting
- **Container Networking**: Isolated bridge networks for services

### Areas for Enhancement ⚠️
- **Network Monitoring**: Limited visibility into traffic patterns
- **Intrusion Detection**: No network-based IDS/IPS
- **Traffic Analysis**: Minimal network forensics capability
- **Firewall Rules**: Basic container-level restrictions only
