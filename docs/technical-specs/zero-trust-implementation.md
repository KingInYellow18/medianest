# Zero-Trust Implementation Guide - MediaNest

**Classification**: Internal Use  
**Last Updated**: September 8, 2025  
**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Review Cycle**: Quarterly  

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive implementation guide for establishing a zero-trust security architecture in MediaNest. Zero-trust operates on the principle "never trust, always verify" and assumes that threats exist both inside and outside the network perimeter.

## Zero-Trust Fundamentals

### Core Principles
1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every user and device must be authenticated and authorized
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
3. **Assume Breach**: Design systems assuming compromise has occurred
4. **Verify Explicitly**: Use all available data points for access decisions
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time visibility and analytics

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-7) - CRITICAL
**Objective**: Establish secure identity and access controls

#### 1.1 Identity Provider Setup
```yaml
Components:
  Primary: Keycloak (Self-hosted)
  Backup: Auth0 integration capability
  
Configuration:
  Realm: medianest-prod
  Users: Database-backed with LDAP sync
  Sessions: JWT with refresh tokens
  MFA: TOTP-based (Google Authenticator compatible)

Required Actions:
  - Deploy Keycloak with PostgreSQL backend
  - Configure OIDC/OAuth2 flows
  - Integrate with existing JWT system
  - Implement MFA for admin accounts
```

#### 1.2 Secrets Management (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Current Critical Issue: Secrets in git repository
# IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

# Step 1: Deploy HashiCorp Vault
docker run -d --name vault \
  --cap-add=IPC_LOCK \
  -p 8200:8200 \
  -v vault-data:/vault/data \
  -v vault-logs:/vault/logs \
  hashicorp/vault:latest

# Step 2: Initialize Vault
vault operator init -key-shares=5 -key-threshold=3

# Step 3: Configure secrets engines
vault auth enable userpass
vault secrets enable -path=medianest kv-v2

# Step 4: Migrate existing secrets
vault kv put medianest/prod/database \
  username=medianest \
  password="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

vault kv put medianest/prod/jwt \
  secret="$(openssl rand -base64 64)"

vault kv put medianest/prod/encryption \
  key="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
```

#### 1.3 Container Security Hardening
```yaml
# Fix Critical UID/GID Mismatch
Dockerfile Changes:
  - RUN groupadd -r -g 10001 medianest
  - RUN useradd -r -u 10001 -g medianest medianest
  - USER medianest:medianest

Docker Compose Alignment:
  user: "10001:10001"
  
Security Context:
  securityContext:
    runAsNonRoot: true
    runAsUser: 10001
    runAsGroup: 10001
    readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

### Phase 2: Policy Engine (Days 8-21)
**Objective**: Implement attribute-based access control

#### 2.1 Open Policy Agent (OPA) Integration
```yaml
Deployment:
  Component: Open Policy Agent
  Mode: Sidecar pattern with Envoy
  Policies: Rego-based authorization rules

Policy Examples:
  api_access:
    - User must be authenticated
    - Valid JWT token required
    - Rate limits based on user tier
    - IP address validation

  admin_access:
    - Admin role required
    - MFA completed within last 4 hours
    - Access from approved networks only
    - Session must be interactive (no API keys)
```

#### 2.2 Network Micro-segmentation
```yaml
Network Policies:
  web_tier:
    ingress:
      - from: traefik-proxy
        ports: [4000]
    egress:
      - to: app-tier
        ports: [4000, 6379, 5432]

  app_tier:
    ingress:
      - from: web-tier
        ports: [4000]
    egress:
      - to: database-tier
        ports: [5432, 6379]

  database_tier:
    ingress:
      - from: app-tier
        ports: [5432, 6379]
    egress: []  # No outbound allowed
```

#### 2.3 Service Mesh Implementation
```yaml
Service Mesh: Istio or Linkerd
Features:
  - mTLS between all services
  - Traffic routing and load balancing
  - Circuit breaker patterns
  - Distributed tracing
  - Security policies enforcement

Configuration:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
  authentication:
    - jwt: 
        issuer: "https://keycloak.medianest.local"
        jwks_uri: "https://keycloak.medianest.local/realms/medianest/protocol/openid_connect/certs"
```

### Phase 3: Continuous Verification (Days 22-60)
**Objective**: Implement continuous monitoring and adaptive security

#### 3.1 Behavioral Analytics
```yaml
Components:
  UEBA: User and Entity Behavior Analytics
  Tools: ELK Stack with ML plugins or Splunk

Monitored Behaviors:
  - Login patterns and locations
  - API usage patterns
  - Data access patterns
  - Failed authentication attempts
  - Privilege escalation attempts

Risk Scoring:
  Low Risk (0-30): Normal access granted
  Medium Risk (31-70): Additional verification required
  High Risk (71-100): Access denied, security team alerted
```

#### 3.2 Automated Response Systems
```yaml
SOAR Integration:
  Platform: Phantom/Splunk or TheHive
  
Automated Responses:
  Suspicious Login:
    - Require MFA re-authentication
    - Limit session duration
    - Increase monitoring

  Multiple Failed Attempts:
    - Account lockout (temporary)
    - IP address blocking
    - Security team notification

  Data Exfiltration Indicators:
    - Block data access
    - Isolate user session
    - Incident response team activation
```

## Identity and Access Management (IAM) Implementation

### Authentication Architecture
```yaml
Multi-Factor Authentication:
  Primary Factor: Username/Password or Certificate
  Secondary Factor: TOTP, SMS, or Hardware Key
  
Authentication Flow:
  1. User provides credentials
  2. Primary authentication validated
  3. Risk assessment performed
  4. MFA challenge if required
  5. JWT issued with appropriate scope
  6. Continuous session validation

Session Management:
  JWT Lifetime: 15 minutes (short-lived)
  Refresh Token: 24 hours
  Remember Me: 30 days (with additional security)
  Concurrent Sessions: Limited per user role
```

### Authorization Model
```yaml
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
  Roles:
    - super_admin: Full system access
    - admin: Administrative functions
    - user: Standard user access
    - readonly: Read-only access
    - api_client: Programmatic access

Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):
  Attributes:
    User: role, department, clearance_level, location
    Resource: classification, owner, sensitivity
    Environment: time, IP, device_trust_level
    Action: read, write, delete, execute

Policy Engine Rules:
  - Admin actions require MFA within 4 hours
  - Sensitive data access restricted by location
  - API access limited by rate and time windows
  - Cross-region access requires approval
```

### Privilege Escalation Protection
```yaml
Just-In-Time (JIT) Access:
  - Temporary privilege elevation
  - Time-bounded access (max 4 hours)
  - Approval workflow for sensitive operations
  - Automatic de-escalation

Privileged Access Management:
  - Break-glass emergency access procedures
  - Session recording for privileged operations
  - Regular access reviews and certification
  - Segregation of duties enforcement
```

## Device Trust and Endpoint Security

### Device Registration
```yaml
Device Trust Framework:
  Registration: Certificate-based device enrollment
  Health Checks: Continuous device compliance validation
  Trust Levels: Trusted, Managed, Unmanaged, Quarantined

Compliance Requirements:
  - Up-to-date operating system
  - Endpoint protection installed
  - Encryption enabled
  - Device certificate valid
  - No jailbreak/root detection
```

### Conditional Access Policies
```yaml
Access Policies:
  Trusted Devices:
    - Full access to resources
    - Standard MFA requirements
    - Extended session timeouts

  Managed Devices:
    - Limited resource access
    - Enhanced MFA requirements
    - Reduced session timeouts

  Unmanaged Devices:
    - Web-only access
    - Frequent re-authentication
    - Limited data download
```

## Data Protection and Encryption

### Encryption Strategy
```yaml
Data at Rest:
  Database: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
  Files: AES-256-GCM with envelope encryption
  Backups: Encrypted with separate key hierarchy
  Key Management: HashiCorp Vault with HSM

Data in Transit:
  External: TLS 1.3 with certificate pinning

  API: HTTPS only with HSTS enforcement

Key Management:
  Rotation: Automated 90-day rotation
  Access: Role-based key access
  Audit: Full key usage logging
  Backup: Secure key escrow procedures
```

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
```yaml
Classification:
  Public: No restrictions
  Internal: Employee access only
  Confidential: Need-to-know basis
  Restricted: Executive approval required

Controls:
  - Content scanning and classification
  - Data export monitoring and approval
  - Email and file sharing restrictions
  - Database query result limitations
```

## Network Security Implementation
