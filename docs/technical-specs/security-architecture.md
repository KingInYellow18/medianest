**Classification**: Internal Use  
**Last Updated**: September 8, 2025  
**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Security Review Required**: Yes  

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive defensive security architecture for MediaNest, implementing defense-in-depth principles with zero-trust assumptions. The framework addresses critical vulnerabilities identified during security assessment while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Current Security Status

### Critical Vulnerabilities Identified
- **CRITICAL**: Production secrets exposed in version control
- **CRITICAL**: Container UID/GID configuration inconsistencies  
- **HIGH**: Hardcoded JWT secrets in multiple files

### Security Strengths
- Comprehensive JWT implementation with algorithm confusion protection
- Strong middleware security stack (CSRF, XSS, input sanitization)
- Network isolation via Traefik reverse proxy
- Container hardening with read-only filesystems

## Defense-in-Depth Architecture

### Layer 1: Perimeter Security
```
Internet → Traefik Reverse Proxy → Application Services
         ↳ SSL/TLS Termination
         ↳ Rate Limiting
         ↳ Security Headers
         ↳ DDoS Protection
```

**Components**:
- **Traefik v3.0**: Reverse proxy with automatic SSL/TLS
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, CORS, Frame Options
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-backed with atomic Lua operations
- **Geographic Filtering**: Country-based access controls

### Layer 2: Network Security
```
External Network → DMZ → Internal Application Network → Database Network
                        ↳ Isolated Container Networks
                        ↳ Internal Service Communication
```

**Network Segmentation**:
- **DMZ**: Traefik proxy only
- **Application Network**: Backend services (172.20.0.0/16)
- **Database Network**: PostgreSQL and Redis isolated
- **No Direct External Access**: All services behind proxy

### Layer 3: Application Security
```
Request → Security Middleware Stack → Authentication → Authorization → Business Logic
         ↳ Input Sanitization     ↳ JWT Validation  ↳ RBAC        ↳ Data Access
         ↳ CSRF Protection        ↳ Session Mgmt    ↳ Permissions ↳ Audit Logging
         ↳ Request Validation     ↳ Rate Limiting   ↳ API Keys    ↳ Encryption
```

**Security Controls**:
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor JWT with refresh tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Input Validation**: Schema validation with sanitization
- **Output Encoding**: Context-aware XSS prevention

### Layer 4: Data Security
```
Application → Encryption at Rest → Database → Backup Encryption
            ↳ Field-level Encryption   ↳ TDE   ↳ Encrypted Backups
            ↳ Key Management           ↳ WAL   ↳ Secure Transfer
```

**Data Protection**:
- **Encryption at Rest**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive fields
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Key Management**: HashiCorp Vault integration
- **Database Security**: Row-level security, audit logging

## Security Architecture Components

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
```yaml
Authentication Flow:
  Primary: JWT with HS256 signing
  MFA: TOTP-based two-factor authentication
  Session: Stateless JWT with refresh tokens
  Password: bcrypt with work factor 12

Authorization Model:
  Type: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
  Roles: [admin, user, readonly, api_client]
  Permissions: Granular resource-based permissions
  Enforcement: Middleware-based with policy engine
```

### 2. Container Security
```yaml
Hardening Measures:
  User: Non-root (UID 10001-10004)
  Filesystem: Read-only with selective writable volumes
  Capabilities: DROP ALL, selective ADD as needed
  Security Contexts:
    - no-new-privileges: true
    - apparmor: docker-default
  Resource Limits:
    - Memory: 1GB max per service
    - CPU: 2.0 cores max
    - PIDs: 1000 max
```

### 3. Secrets Management
```yaml
Current Issues (CRITICAL):
  - Secrets in version control: IMMEDIATE REMEDIATION REQUIRED
  - Hardcoded JWT keys: ROTATE ALL SECRETS

Target Architecture:
  Provider: HashiCorp Vault
  Rotation: Automated 90-day rotation
  Distribution: Docker Secrets or Kubernetes Secrets
  Encryption: AES-256-GCM with HSM backing
```

### 4. Network Security
```yaml
Network Policies:
  External: Only HTTPS (443) and HTTP redirect (80)
  Internal: Service-to-service encryption via mTLS
  Database: No external access, internal network only
  Monitoring: Dedicated monitoring network segment

Firewall Rules:
  Ingress: Deny all except specific allowed ports
  Egress: Allow specific outbound connections only
  Inter-service: Least privilege network policies
```

### 5. Monitoring and Logging
```yaml
Security Monitoring:
  Authentication: Failed login attempts, MFA failures
  Authorization: Permission denials, privilege escalation
  Network: Unusual traffic patterns, port scanning
  Application: Suspicious input patterns, error rates

Log Management:
  Collection: Structured JSON logging
  Storage: Encrypted log aggregation
  Retention: 90 days active, 2 years archived
  Analysis: SIEM integration for threat detection
```

## Zero-Trust Implementation

### Core Principles
1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Every request authenticated and authorized
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for all entities
3. **Assume Breach**: Design for containment and detection
4. **Verify Explicitly**: Multi-factor authentication required

### Implementation Strategy
```yaml
Phase 1 - Foundation (Immediate):
  - Fix critical vulnerabilities (secrets, containers)
  - Implement proper secret management
  - Strengthen authentication controls

Phase 2 - Enhancement (30 days):
  - Implement micro-segmentation
  - Deploy comprehensive monitoring
  - Add threat detection capabilities

Phase 3 - Maturity (90 days):
  - Implement continuous compliance
  - Add behavioral analytics
  - Automated incident response
```
