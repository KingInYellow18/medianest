# Incident Response Procedures - MediaNest

**Classification**: Internal Use  
**Last Updated**: September 8, 2025  
**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Framework**: NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2  

## Executive Summary

This document establishes comprehensive incident response procedures for MediaNest, providing structured processes for detecting, analyzing, containing, and recovering from security incidents. The framework follows NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 guidelines and integrates with the existing security infrastructure.

## Current Security Context

### Security Strengths to Leverage ✅
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Application, network, and security logs available
- **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Prometheus, ELK stack for real-time monitoring
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated networks for containment capabilities
- **Container Security**: Hardened containers for rapid isolation
- **Authentication System**: Strong JWT implementation with blacklisting

### Critical Vulnerabilities to Address ❌
- **Secrets Exposure**: Production secrets in version control (immediate risk)
- **No Formal IR Process**: Lack of structured incident response procedures
- **Limited Forensics**: No formal forensic analysis capabilities
- **Incomplete Monitoring**: Gaps in security event detection

## Incident Response Framework

### NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2 Implementation
