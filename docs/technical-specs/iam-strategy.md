# Identity and Access Management (IAM) Strategy - MediaNest

**Classification**: Internal Use  
**Last Updated**: September 8, 2025  
**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Framework**: NIST 800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines  

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM) strategy for MediaNest, building upon the existing strong JWT implementation while addressing critical vulnerabilities and implementing enterprise-grade access controls. The strategy follows NIST 800-63 guidelines and zero-trust principles.

## Current IAM Assessment

### Strengths Identified ✅
- **Robust JWT Implementation**: Algorithm confusion protection, proper signature validation
- **Comprehensive Authentication Middleware**: IP validation, user agent hashing, session management
- **Token Security**: Blacklisting, rotation support, secure facade pattern
- **Multi-factor Considerations**: Framework ready for MFA implementation
- **Rate Limiting**: Authentication attempt throttling (5 attempts/15min)

### Critical Vulnerabilities ❌
- **Secrets Exposure**: JWT secret hardcoded and exposed in version control
- **Key Management**: No automated secret rotation or secure key storage
- **MFA Gap**: Multi-factor authentication not yet implemented
- **Session Management**: Limited session lifecycle controls

### Enhancement Opportunities ⚠️
- **Centralized Identity Provider**: No single identity authority
- **Fine-grained Authorization**: Basic RBAC implementation
- **Identity Federation**: No external identity provider integration
- **Privileged Access Management**: Limited admin access controls

### Identity Integration Strategy
```yaml
Current JWT System Integration:
  Phase 1: Parallel Operation
    - Keycloak runs alongside existing JWT system
    - New users authenticate via Keycloak
    - Existing users maintain current authentication
    - Token validation accepts both systems
    
  Phase 2: Migration
    - User accounts migrated to Keycloak
    - Password reset flow triggers migration
    - Dual token validation during transition
    - Legacy JWT system deprecated
    
  Phase 3: Full Replacement
    - All authentication via Keycloak
    - Single token validation endpoint
    - Legacy system decommissioned
    
Token Strategy:
  Access Token: JWT (15-minute lifetime)
  Refresh Token: Opaque token (24-hour lifetime)  
  ID Token: JWT with user profile information
  Session Token: Browser session management
```

## Authentication Strategy

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

      - QR code setup, backup codes provided
      
    SMS/Voice:
      - Twilio integration for SMS delivery
      - Rate limiting: max 3 SMS per 15 minutes

      - YubiKey, Titan, SoloKey compatibility
      - Backup key requirement
      
  MFA Policies:
    Admin Users: MFA required for all access
    Standard Users: MFA required for sensitive operations
    API Clients: Certificate-based authentication
    High-Risk Context: Step-up authentication required
    
Risk-Based Authentication:
  Low Risk (Normal patterns): Standard authentication
  Medium Risk (Unusual location/device): MFA challenge
  High Risk (Suspicious activity): Account lock + investigation
  
Contextual Factors:
  - User location (IP geolocation)

## Authorization Framework

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```yaml
Role Hierarchy:
  super_admin:
    description: "System administrator with full access"
    permissions:
      - system:*
      - users:*
      - configuration:*
      - audit:read
    inheritance: []
    
  admin:
    description: "Administrative user with operational access"
    permissions:
      - users:read,create,update
      - configuration:read,update
      - monitoring:read
      - audit:read
    inheritance: []
    
  moderator:
    description: "Content moderation and user management"
    permissions:
      - content:read,update,delete
      - users:read,update
      - reports:read,update
    inheritance: [user]
    
  user:
    description: "Standard user with basic application access"
    permissions:
      - profile:read,update
      - content:read,create
      - requests:read,create

      - monitoring:read
      - audit:read
    inheritance: []

Permission Structure:
  Format: resource:action
  Resources: system, users, content, configuration, audit, monitoring
  Actions: create, read, update, delete, execute
  Wildcards: system:* (all actions on system resource)
```

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
```yaml
ABAC Policy Engine (Open Policy Agent):
  Subject Attributes:
    - user.id, user.roles, user.department
    - user.clearance_level, user.location
    - user.mfa_verified, user.session_age
    
  Resource Attributes:
    - resource.type, resource.owner
    - resource.classification, resource.sensitivity
    - resource.department, resource.project
    
  Environment Attributes:
    - time.hour, time.day_of_week
    - network.ip, network.location
    - device.trusted, device.managed
    - action.type, action.urgency
    
  Action Attributes:
    - action.type (read, write, delete, execute)
    - action.scope (individual, bulk, admin)
    - action.risk_level (low, medium, high)

Example Policies:
  # Admin actions require MFA within 4 hours
  allow if {
    "admin" in input.user.roles
    input.action.type == "admin_operation"
    time.now_ns() - input.user.mfa_timestamp < 4 * 3600 * 1000000000
  }
  
  # High-risk actions require approval
  allow if {
    input.action.risk_level == "high"
    input.request.approval_status == "approved"
    input.user.clearance_level >= input.resource.required_clearance
  }
  
  # Restrict access by location
  allow if {
    input.user.location in data.approved_locations
    input.network.ip in data.trusted_networks
    input.device.managed == true
  }
```
