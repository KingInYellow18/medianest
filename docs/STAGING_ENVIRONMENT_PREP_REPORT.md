# MediaNest Staging Environment Preparation Report

**Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Environment:** Staging  
**Status:** CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

## Executive Summary

The staging environment preparation has revealed several critical issues that must be resolved before live testing can commence. While the codebase merge is complete, there are significant dependency and configuration issues that prevent the application from building successfully.

## Environment Validation Results

### ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

- Git repository is up-to-date with staging branch
- Basic project structure is intact
- Package.json configurations are present
- Docker configuration files exist
- Environment template files are available
- Claude-Flow MCP servers are operational

### ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ACTION**

#### 1. Missing Core Dependencies

**STATUS: CRITICAL** - Application cannot build

- **Missing:** `zod`, `express`, `bcrypt`, `ioredis`, `winston`, `winston-daily-rotate-file`
- **Impact:** Complete build failure
- **Action Required:** Install all missing dependencies immediately

#### 2. Prisma Configuration Issues

**STATUS: CRITICAL** - Database layer non-functional

- Multiple Prisma schema locations (backend/prisma, frontend/prisma)
- Prisma client generation failing
- TypeScript compilation errors due to missing Prisma imports
- **Action Required:** Centralize Prisma configuration and regenerate clients

#### 3. TypeScript Configuration Problems

**STATUS: HIGH** - Type safety compromised

- Missing type definitions for core modules
- User property extensions not properly configured
- Multiple compilation errors in shared and backend modules
- **Action Required:** Fix type definitions and extend Express Request interface

#### 4. Test Infrastructure Issues

**STATUS: HIGH** - Testing capabilities compromised

- Test files failing to load (2 failed test files)
- Missing test setup configurations
- Backend test setup references non-existent modules
- **Action Required:** Rebuild test infrastructure

## Detailed Issue Analysis

### Build Status

```bash
npm run build: FAILED
- 17+ TypeScript compilation errors
- Missing dependencies preventing compilation
- Prisma client import failures
```

### Test Status

```bash
npm run test: FAILED
- 2 test files failed to load
- No tests actually executed
- Test configuration issues
```

### Database Connectivity

```bash
Status: UNKNOWN
- No database ping utility available
- Prisma client not generated
- Connection status cannot be verified
```

### Environment Configuration

```bash
Status: INCOMPLETE
- Only NODE_ENV environment variable found
- Critical database and API configurations missing
- No staging-specific .env file present
```

## Required Immediate Actions (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Critical Dependencies (IMMEDIATE - 30 minutes)

1. **Install Core Runtime Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install zod express bcrypt ioredis winston winston-daily-rotate-file
   ```

2. **Install Prisma Packages**

   ```bash
   npm install prisma @prisma/client
   ```

3. **Generate Prisma Clients**
   ```bash
   cd backend && npx prisma generate
   cd frontend && npx prisma generate
   ```

### Phase 2: Configuration Fixes (1 hour)

1. **Fix TypeScript Type Extensions**
   - Create proper Express Request interface extensions
   - Fix shared module type definitions
   - Resolve user property access issues

2. **Centralize Prisma Configuration**
   - Determine single source of truth for schema
   - Update import paths across all modules
   - Ensure consistent client generation

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - Create staging-specific .env file
   - Configure database connections
   - Set up Redis connections
   - Configure API keys and secrets

### Phase 3: Test Infrastructure Rebuild (1-2 hours)

1. **Fix Test Setup Files**
   - Resolve missing module references
   - Configure test database connections
   - Set up proper mocking infrastructure

2. **Validate Test Execution**
   - Ensure all test files can load
   - Run basic smoke tests
   - Verify testing infrastructure

### Phase 4: Build Validation (30 minutes)

1. **Complete Build Test**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Verify All Modules Compile**
   - Check shared module compilation
   - Verify backend compilation
   - Confirm frontend compatibility

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK AREAS

- **Database Operations**: Prisma client issues could cause runtime failures
- **Authentication**: TypeScript errors in user property access could break auth
- **API Endpoints**: Express type issues could cause routing problems
- **Error Handling**: Type safety issues could mask runtime errors

### MEDIUM RISK AREAS

- **Testing**: Limited ability to validate functionality
- **Monitoring**: No logging system verification completed
- **Performance**: Build issues prevent performance baseline establishment

## Rollback Strategy

### Immediate Rollback Plan

If critical issues cannot be resolved within 4 hours:

1. **Revert to Last Known Good State**

   ```bash
   git checkout de92d677  # Last working commit before merge
   ```

2. **Alternative Staging Approach**
   - Deploy individual modules separately
   - Use Docker containers to isolate dependency issues
   - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout

3. **Emergency Procedures**
   - Notify development team immediately
   - Document all attempted fixes
   - Prepare production environment as backup

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Next 4 hours)

1. **Focus on Critical Path**: Fix dependencies and build issues first
2. **Parallel Workstreams**: Have multiple team members work on different issues simultaneously
3. **Continuous Testing**: Test each fix incrementally to avoid regression

### Medium-term (Next 24 hours)

1. **Comprehensive Testing**: Once build is fixed, run full test suite
2. **Performance Baseline**: Establish performance metrics for comparison
3. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement logging and monitoring systems
4. **Security Review**: Verify all security configurations

### Long-term (Next Sprint)

1. **Dependency Management**: Implement better dependency tracking
2. **CI/CD Improvements**: Add pre-merge dependency validation
3. **Environment Parity**: Ensure staging exactly matches production
4. **Documentation**: Update deployment and troubleshooting guides

## Testing Checklist (Post-Fix)

### Pre-Flight Checks

- [ ] All dependencies installed successfully
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] All TypeScript compilation issues resolved
- [ ] Prisma clients generated and functional
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database connectivity verified

### Functional Testing Areas

- [ ] User authentication and authorization
- [ ] API endpoint functionality
- [ ] Database operations (CRUD)
- [ ] File upload/download operations
- [ ] Real-time features (WebSocket connections)
- [ ] External service integrations (Plex, Overseerr)

### Performance Testing

- [ ] Application startup time
- [ ] API response times
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Memory usage patterns
- [ ] CPU utilization under load

### Security Testing

- [ ] Authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] CORS configuration

## Conclusion

The staging environment is currently in a **NON-FUNCTIONAL STATE** due to critical dependency and configuration issues. **Live testing cannot proceed** until these issues are resolved. The estimated time to resolution is **2-4 hours** with dedicated team effort.

**RECOMMENDATION: DELAY LIVE TESTING** until all critical issues are resolved and basic functionality is verified through automated tests.

---

**Next Steps:**

1. Assign team members to resolve critical issues in parallel
2. Implement fixes in priority order
3. Validate each fix before proceeding to the next
4. Update this report as issues are resolved
5. Conduct final environment validation before declaring ready for live testing
