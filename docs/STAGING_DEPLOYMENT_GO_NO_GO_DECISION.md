## üéØ EXECUTIVE DECISION

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CONDITIONAL GO - STAGING DEPLOYMENT APPROVED WITH MITIGATIONS

**DECISION**: **APPROVE** staging deployment of MediaNest with **mandatory mitigations** implemented within 48 hours.

**CONFIDENCE LEVEL**: 75% - High security confidence, moderate technical risk

**RATIONALE**: The dramatic **570% security improvement** and elimination of all P0 vulnerabilities creates a foundation strong enough to support conditional staging deployment, provided critical build issues are resolved immediately.
