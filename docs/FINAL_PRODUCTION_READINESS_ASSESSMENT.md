# Impact: Cannot deploy containers without manual intervention

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Fix shared/package.json dependencies (add dev dependencies)
2. Copy tsconfig.base.json to Docker build context
3. Resolve module resolution paths in Docker environment
4. Test complete Docker build process
```

#### 2. ‚ö° Performance Bundle Optimization

## üìä RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION STRATEGY

### üî¥ HIGH RISK - Build System Failures

**Probability**: 95% - Docker builds currently fail  
**Impact**: Cannot deploy without manual intervention  
**Mitigation**: Emergency build fixes (24-48 hours)  
**Business Impact**: Development productivity blocked

### üü† MEDIUM RISK - Performance Issues

**Probability**: 100% - Bundle size is 93,000% over target  
**Impact**: Poor user experience, high resource consumption  
**Mitigation**: Emergency optimization (immediate), full optimization (1-2 weeks)  
**Business Impact**: User satisfaction, operational costs

### üü° LOW RISK - Operational Complexity

**Probability**: 60% - Manual orchestration setup required  
**Impact**: Deployment complexity, human error potential  
**Mitigation**: Automation scripts, documentation
