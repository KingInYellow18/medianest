# MediaNest Manual Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive manual testing procedures for MediaNest in a homelab environment. It's designed for testing with real Plex, Overseerr, and Uptime Kuma instances with 10-20 concurrent users.

## Pre-Test Setup

### 1. Environment Verification

```bash
# Check all services are running
docker compose ps

# Verify environment variables
docker compose exec backend env | grep -E "(PLEX|OVERSEERR|DATABASE|REDIS)"

# Check database connectivity
docker compose exec backend npx prisma db push --accept-data-loss

# Verify Redis connection
docker compose exec backend redis-cli -h redis ping
```

### 2. Service URLs

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:4000/api/v1
- API Docs: http://localhost:4000/api-docs
- Prisma Studio: http://localhost:5555
- Redis Commander: http://localhost:8081

### 3. Test Data Setup

```sql
-- Connect to database
docker compose exec postgres psql -U medianest -d medianest

-- Create test users (if needed)
-- Admin bootstrap should create initial admin
-- Other users created via Plex OAuth
```

## Post-Test Checklist

### Data Verification

```sql
-- Check user creation
SELECT username, email, role, status, created_at
FROM users
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check media requests
SELECT u.username, mr.title, mr.media_type, mr.status, mr.requested_at
FROM media_requests mr
JOIN users u ON mr.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY mr.requested_at DESC;

-- Check download history
SELECT u.username, yd.title, yd.status, yd.progress, yd.created_at
FROM youtube_downloads yd
JOIN users u ON yd.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY yd.created_at DESC;

-- Check service status history
SELECT service, status, response_time, checked_at
FROM service_status
WHERE checked_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY checked_at DESC;
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
# Check for errors
docker compose logs backend | grep -i error

# Check for warnings
docker compose logs backend | grep -i warn

# Check authentication logs
docker compose logs backend | grep -i "auth"

# Check WebSocket connections
docker compose logs backend | grep -i "socket"
```

### Performance Metrics

```bash
# Container resource usage
docker stats --no-stream

# Database connections
docker compose exec postgres psql -U medianest -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Redis memory usage
docker compose exec redis redis-cli INFO memory
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Plex OAuth not working**
   - Verify Plex server is accessible
   - Check firewall rules
   - Ensure correct client ID/secret
   - Try incognito mode

2. **Services showing offline**
   - Verify service URLs are correct
   - Check from MediaNest container: `docker compose exec backend curl [service-url]`
   - Verify API keys are valid
   - Check service logs

3. **YouTube downloads failing**
   - Check yt-dlp is installed
   - Verify output directory permissions
   - Check disk space
   - Try updating yt-dlp

4. **WebSocket disconnections**
   - Check browser console
   - Verify no proxy interference
   - Check nginx configuration
   - Look for rate limiting

### Performance Optimization

1. **Slow page loads**
   - Enable Redis caching
   - Check database indexes
   - Review API response times
   - Enable CDN for assets

2. **High memory usage**
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Review Redis memory settings
   - Limit concurrent downloads
   - Adjust Node.js heap size
