# Quality Gates & Validation Checkpoints - MediaNest Project

> **Gate Definition Date**: September 5, 2024  
> **Quality Engineer**: Tester Agent (Hive Mind Collective Intelligence)  
> **Enforcement Level**: Mandatory across all development branches

## Overview

Quality gates serve as automated checkpoints that prevent low-quality code from progressing through the development pipeline. Each gate enforces specific criteria that must be met before code can advance to the next stage.

### Gate Philosophy

- **Fail Fast**: Catch issues early in the development cycle
- **Automated Enforcement**: No manual overrides without proper justification
- **Progressive Strictness**: More rigorous requirements as code approaches production
- **Measurable Criteria**: Clear, objective standards for all quality metrics

## Gate 1: Pre-Commit Validation 🔍

### Purpose

Prevent obviously flawed code from entering the repository

### Trigger

Executed automatically before each git commit via git hooks

### Validation Criteria

#### Code Quality Standards

```yaml
Linting:
  ESLint:
    - Zero errors: MANDATORY
    - Zero warnings in critical files: MANDATORY
    - Max warnings overall: 5
  Prettier:
    - Code formatting: 100% compliant
    - Consistent style: MANDATORY

Type Safety:
  TypeScript:
    - Zero type errors: MANDATORY
    - Strict mode compliance: MANDATORY
    - No 'any' types in new code: PREFERRED
```

#### Security Validation

```yaml
Security Scanning:
  Secret Detection:
    - No hardcoded secrets: MANDATORY
    - No API keys in code: MANDATORY
    - Environment variable usage: VALIDATED

  Dependency Scanning:
    - High/Critical vulnerabilities: ZERO
    - Medium vulnerabilities: <5
    - License compliance: VALIDATED
```

#### Basic Testing

```yaml
Unit Tests:
  Execution:
    - All existing tests pass: 100%
    - Test execution time: <30 seconds
    - No test failures: MANDATORY

  Coverage (for modified files):
    - Statement coverage: >70
    - Branch coverage: >60
    - New code coverage: >80
```

### Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .husky/pre-commit

echo "🔍 Running pre-commit quality gates..."

# 1. Lint staged files
npx lint-staged
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Linting failed"
  exit 1
fi

# 2. Type check
npm run type-check
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Type checking failed"
  exit 1
fi

# 3. Run unit tests for modified files
npm run test:changed
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Unit tests failed"
  exit 1
fi

# 4. Security scan
npm audit --audit-level=high
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Security vulnerabilities detected"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Pre-commit validation passed"
```

### Bypass Protocol

- **Emergency commits**: `git commit --no-verify` (requires justification)
- **Review required**: All bypass commits must be reviewed immediately
- **Technical debt**: Create issue for any bypassed validations
