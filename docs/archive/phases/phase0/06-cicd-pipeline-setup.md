# Task: CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Duration:** 2 hours  
**Dependencies:** 03-linting-formatting-setup, 05-docker-configuration  
**Phase:** 0 (Week 1 - Day 3)

## Objective

**Status:** âœ… Complete

Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing, set up branch protection rules, configure automated dependency updates with Dependabot, establish code coverage reporting, and create PR templates and contributing guidelines.

## Background

A robust CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and automates repetitive tasks. This setup will catch issues early and maintain high code standards throughout development.

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflows

- Main CI workflow for tests and linting
- Docker build verification
- Dependency security scanning
- Code coverage reporting

### 2. Branch Protection

- Require PR reviews
- Require status checks
- Prevent force pushes
- Enforce linear history

### 3. Automated Updates

- Dependabot for npm packages
- Security vulnerability alerts
- Automated PR creation

### 4. Documentation

- PR template
- Issue templates
- Contributing guidelines
- Code of conduct

### Branch Protection Settings (via GitHub UI)

```
Main Branch Protection:
- Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
- Dismiss stale pull request approvals
- Require review from CODEOWNERS
- Require status checks to pass:
  - ci/lint
  - ci/test
  - ci/build
- Require branches to be up to date
- Require conversation resolution
- Require signed commits (optional)
- Include administrators
- Restrict who can push (maintainers only)

Develop Branch Protection:
- Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
- Require status checks to pass:
  - ci/lint

- Require branches to be up to date
```

## Acceptance Criteria

1. âœ… CI workflow runs on all PRs
2. âœ… Tests run automatically
3. âœ… Linting enforced
4. âœ… Docker builds verified
5. âœ… Dependabot creates PRs
6. âœ… Branch protection active
7. âœ… PR template used
8. âœ… Code coverage reported

## Testing Requirements

1. Create a test PR and verify workflows run
2. Check that failing tests block merge
3. Verify Dependabot configuration
4. Test PR template appears
5. Confirm branch protection works

## Setup Commands

```bash
# Create workflow directories
mkdir -p .github/workflows
mkdir -p .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE

# Create workflow files
touch .github/workflows/ci.yml
touch .github/workflows/pr-check.yml
touch .github/dependabot.yml
touch .github/pull_request_template.md
touch CONTRIBUTING.md

# Add CI badge to README
echo "![CI](https://github.com/your-username/medianest/workflows/CI/badge.svg)" >> README.md
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Workflows not running**: Check file permissions and YAML syntax
2. **Service containers failing**: Ensure health checks are correct
3. **Coverage not uploading**: Verify Codecov token is set
4. **Dependabot not working**: Check configuration syntax

## Next Steps

- Complete Phase 0 documentation
- Begin Phase 1 implementation
- Set up monitoring for CI/CD

## Completion Notes

- Completed on: July 4, 2025
- All acceptance criteria met
- Ready for production use
