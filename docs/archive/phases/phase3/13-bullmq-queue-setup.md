# Phase 3: BullMQ Queue Setup for YouTube Downloads - ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** Redis configuration, YouTube URL submission interface  
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours

## Objective

Set up BullMQ job queue for processing YouTube downloads asynchronously, with proper user isolation and progress tracking.

## Background

YouTube downloads need to be processed in the background to avoid blocking the API. BullMQ provides a robust Redis-based queue system with progress tracking, retries, and failure handling.

## Tasks

### 1. Install and Configure BullMQ

- [ ] Install BullMQ dependencies: `bullmq`, `@types/bullmq`
- [ ] Create queue configuration with Redis connection
- [ ] Set up queue options (concurrency, retries, backoff)
- [ ] Configure rate limiting (5 downloads/hour per user)

### 2. Create Queue Definitions

- [ ] Define YouTube download job interface with TypeScript
- [ ] Create queue for download jobs
- [ ] Create queue for progress updates
- [ ] Set up job priorities based on user roles

### 3. Implement Job Processor

- [ ] Create worker process for handling downloads
- [ ] Implement user isolation (separate directories)
- [ ] Add progress reporting during download
- [ ] Handle job failures and retries
- [ ] Implement cleanup for cancelled jobs

### 4. Create Queue Management Service

- [ ] Build service layer for queue operations
- [ ] Implement job creation with validation
- [ ] Add job status tracking methods
- [ ] Create user-scoped job queries
- [ ] Add rate limiting enforcement

### 5. WebSocket Integration

- [ ] Emit download progress events
- [ ] Handle job completion notifications
- [ ] Send failure notifications
- [ ] Update UI in real-time

### 6. Error Handling

- [ ] Handle network failures gracefully
- [ ] Implement exponential backoff for retries
- [ ] Log errors with correlation IDs
- [ ] Send user-friendly error messages

## Implementation Details

```typescript
// Example job interface
interface YouTubeDownloadJob {
  userId: string;
  playlistUrl: string;
  downloadPath: string;
  priority: number;
  metadata: {
    title?: string;
    channelName?: string;
    videoCount?: number;
  };
}

// Queue configuration
const downloadQueue = new Queue('youtube-downloads', {
  connection: redisConnection,
  defaultJobOptions: {
    attempts: 3,
    backoff: {
      type: 'exponential',
      delay: 2000,
    },
    removeOnComplete: 100,
    removeOnFail: 1000,
  },
});
```

## Testing Requirements

- [ ] Unit tests for queue service methods
- [ ] Integration tests with Redis
- [ ] Test rate limiting enforcement
- [ ] Test user isolation
- [ ] Test progress reporting
- [ ] Test failure scenarios

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Downloads process asynchronously
- [ ] Progress updates in real-time
- [ ] Rate limiting enforced per user
- [ ] User downloads isolated
- [ ] Graceful failure handling
- [ ] No queue memory leaks

## Notes

- Use BullMQ's built-in features for rate limiting
- Ensure job data doesn't contain sensitive information
- Consider job retention policies for storage
- Monitor queue health metrics
