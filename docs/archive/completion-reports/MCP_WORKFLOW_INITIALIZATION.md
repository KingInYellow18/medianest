# MCP Workflow Initialization Report

## Date: 2025-01-19

## Summary

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) workflow system has been successfully initialized for the MediaNest project according to the specifications in CLAUDE_CUSTOM.md.

## Completed Initialization Steps

### 1. Task Directory Structure ‚úÖ

Created the following directory structure under `tasks/`:

- `active/` - For currently in-progress tasks
- `pending/` - For tasks waiting to be started
- `completed/2025/01/` - For finished tasks (organized by year/month)
- `blocked/` - For tasks with external dependencies
- `templates/` - Contains task templates
- `backlog/` - For future tasks and ideas

### 2. Task Templates ‚úÖ

Created three task templates in `tasks/templates/`:

- `bug-fix-template.md` - For bug fixes and issue resolution
- `feature-template.md` - For new feature implementation
- `refactor-template.md` - For code refactoring tasks

### 3. MCP Server Status üü°

Verified MCP server connectivity with mixed results:

#### Available Services:

- ‚úÖ **Knowledge Graph** (mcp\_\_knowledge-graph): Functional and populated with MediaNest architecture
- ‚úÖ **Memory** (mcp\_\_memory): Functional (appears to be same as Knowledge Graph)
- ‚úÖ **Puppeteer** (mcp\_\_puppeteer): Available for browser automation

#### Not Available:

- ‚ùå **Context7**: No server connection (will impact documentation lookups)
- ‚ùå **Perplexity**: Not configured (will impact research capabilities)
- ‚ùå **OpenMemory**: Not available as separate service

### 4. Knowledge Graph Population ‚úÖ

Successfully added MCP workflow entities to the Knowledge Graph:

- Created `MCPWorkflow` entity with workflow specifications
- Created `TaskManagement` entity for the overall system
- Established relationships with MediaNest project

### 5. Documentation ‚úÖ

Created the following documentation:

- `tasks/MCP_WORKFLOW_README.md` - Overview of the task management system
- `tasks/pending/task-20250119-1045-configure-mcp-servers.md` - Initial task for MCP setup
- This initialization report

## Workflow Usage Instructions

### Creating New Tasks

1. Copy appropriate template from `tasks/templates/`
2. Rename with format: `task-YYYYMMDD-HHmm-description.md`
3. Place in `tasks/pending/`
4. Fill out all sections

### Task Lifecycle

1. **Pending** ‚Üí **Active**: When starting work
2. **Active** ‚Üí **Completed**: When finished (move to `completed/YYYY/MM/`)
3. **Active** ‚Üí **Blocked**: If external dependencies arise

### Working Without Full MCP Servers

Since Context7 and Perplexity are unavailable:

- Use local documentation and codebase search for library references
- Rely on Knowledge Graph for project context
- Document findings in task files for future reference

## Next Steps

1. **Move MCP configuration task to active**:

   ```bash
   mv tasks/pending/task-20250119-1045-configure-mcp-servers.md tasks/active/
   ```

2. **For each new development session**:

   - Check `tasks/active/` for current work
   - Review Knowledge Graph for project context
   - Update task progress logs throughout work
   - Archive completed tasks properly

3. **Maintain the workflow**:
   - Keep task files updated with progress
   - Store learnings in Knowledge Graph
   - Use consistent naming conventions

## Recommendations

1. **Context7 Alternative**: Since Context7 is unavailable, consider:

   - Using the built-in Grep/Read tools for documentation lookup
   - Maintaining a local documentation cache
   - Adding library version info to Knowledge Graph

2. **Task Prioritization**: Review existing phase-based tasks and consider:

   - Converting high-priority items to the new task format
   - Creating a migration plan for active development work

3. **Automation Opportunities**:
   - Consider scripts for task file movement
   - Automate task ID generation
   - Create task status reporting tools

## Conclusion

The MCP workflow infrastructure is now in place and ready for use. While not all MCP servers are available, the core task management system and Knowledge Graph integration are fully functional. This provides a solid foundation for AI-assisted development workflows on the MediaNest project.
