## ðŸ“ˆ TECHNICAL DEBT TRACKING AUTOMATION

### **Debt Accumulation Monitoring**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated Technical Debt Assessment
# Runs every 4 hours, stores results in shared memory

# Initialize claude-flow assessment
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "DEBT_ASSESSMENT" \
  --agents 3 \
  --focus "debt_tracking" \
  --memory-namespace "CONTINUOUS_MONITORING_$(date +%Y_%m_%d)"

# Calculate current debt metrics
CURRENT_DEBT=$(npx claude-flow@alpha memory query "total_debt_hours")
INTEREST_RATE=$(npx claude-flow@alpha memory query "annual_interest_rate") 
VELOCITY_IMPACT=$(npx claude-flow@alpha memory query "velocity_loss_percentage")

# Store trend data
npx claude-flow@alpha memory store "debt_trend" \
  --value "{\"timestamp\":\"$(date -Iseconds)\",\"debt\":$CURRENT_DEBT,\"interest\":$INTEREST_RATE,\"velocity\":$VELOCITY_IMPACT}" \
  --namespace "DEBT_TRENDS"

# Alert on concerning trends
if [ "$VELOCITY_IMPACT" -gt 30 ]; then
    npx claude-flow@alpha alert send "critical" \
      --message "Technical debt velocity impact exceeds 30%: $VELOCITY_IMPACT%" \
      --channels "engineering,management"
fi
```

### **Deployment Readiness Scoring**
```python
# Real-time Deployment Readiness Calculator
import sqlite3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def calculate_deployment_readiness():
    """Calculate live deployment readiness score"""
    
    scores = {
        'test_coverage': get_test_coverage_score(),      # 25%
        'api_completeness': get_api_completeness_score(), # 25%  
        'performance': get_performance_score(),           # 20%
        'security': get_security_score(),                # 15%
        'documentation': get_documentation_score(),       # 10%
        'technical_debt': get_debt_score()               # 5%
    }
    
    weighted_score = (
        scores['test_coverage'] * 0.25 +
        scores['api_completeness'] * 0.25 +
        scores['performance'] * 0.20 +
        scores['security'] * 0.15 +
        scores['documentation'] * 0.10 +
        scores['technical_debt'] * 0.05
    )
    
    # Store in shared memory for dashboard
    store_readiness_score(weighted_score, scores)
    
    # Alert if score drops significantly
    if weighted_score < 70:
        send_deployment_readiness_alert(weighted_score, scores)
    
    return weighted_score, scores

# Run every 15 minutes via cron
```

### **Automated Remediation Suggestions**
```yaml
remediation_engine:
  triggers:
    - "technical_debt_increase > 10%"
    - "test_coverage_decrease > 5%"
    - "performance_regression > 15%"
    - "security_score_drop > any"
    
  actions:
    generate_suggestions:
      agent: "technical-debt-best-practices-agent"
      context: "recent_changes,current_priorities,team_capacity"
      output: "prioritized_action_plan"
      
    estimate_effort:
      agent: "technical-debt-economist"
      analysis: "roi_calculation,timeline_impact,resource_requirements"
      output: "effort_estimates_with_confidence"
      
    create_tickets:
      system: "github_issues"
      template: "technical_debt_remediation"
      assignment: "auto_assign_by_expertise"

## ðŸŽ¯ PROACTIVE REGRESSION PREVENTION

### **Predictive Risk Analysis**
```sql  
-- Risk Prediction Query (runs hourly)
SELECT 
    component,
    current_debt_hours,
    weekly_growth_rate,
    predicted_debt_30_days,
    risk_level,
    recommended_action
FROM technical_debt_trends t1
JOIN risk_predictions r ON t1.component = r.component
WHERE 
    predicted_debt_30_days > current_debt_hours * 1.5  -- 50% increase predicted
    OR risk_level = 'HIGH'
ORDER BY predicted_debt_30_days DESC;
```
