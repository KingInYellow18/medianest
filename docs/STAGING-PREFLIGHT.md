# Staging Deployment Pre-Flight Checklist

## Local Validation ✅

- [x] TypeScript compiles
- [x] App starts locally
- [ ] Docker config valid (Issue: docker-compose config failing)
- [ ] All changes committed (monitoring data needs handling)

## Remote Push Ready

- [x] Git remote accessible
- [x] Branch: develop
- [x] Target: staging
- [x] Backup tag: backup-before-staging-20250912-003046

## Staging Environment

- [ ] Have staging server SSH access
- [ ] Know staging server URL
- [ ] Database backup planned
- [ ] Team notified of deployment

## Deployment Files

- [ ] .env.staging.example exists (MISSING - needs creation)
- [x] Start script ready
- [ ] Deployment scripts ready
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented
- [ ] Monitoring endpoints noted

## Post-Deployment Plan

- [ ] Will monitor logs for 30 mins
- [ ] Will check all health endpoints
- [ ] Will verify monitoring (Grafana/Prometheus)
- [ ] Will run smoke tests
- [x] Have rollback command ready: `git reset --hard backup-before-staging-20250912-003046`

## Emergency Contacts

- [ ] On-call person identified
- [ ] Escalation path clear
- [ ] Communication channel ready

## Issues Found

1. **Docker Compose**: Config validation failing
2. **Staging Env**: .env.staging.example file missing
3. **Uncommitted Files**: Monitoring data files not committed
4. **No remote changes**: Already synced with origin/develop

## GO/NO-GO Decision

All items checked: [ ] NO → FIX ISSUES FIRST

- Need to handle monitoring data files
- Need to create .env.staging.example
- Need to fix Docker compose config

## Deployment Command Sequence (AFTER FIXES)

1. git add monitoring data or add to .gitignore
2. git commit if needed
3. git push origin develop
4. SSH to staging server
5. git pull origin develop
6. npm install
7. npm run build
8. npm run migrate (if applicable)
9. pm2 restart app / docker-compose up -d
10. Verify health checks
11. Monitor for 30 minutes
