## If Push Fails

### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Check remote URL
git remote -v

# Update remote if needed (replace with your actual repo)
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/[username]/medianest.git

# Or use SSH if configured
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:[username]/medianest.git
```

```bash
# If conflicts occur during staging merge
git status
# Resolve conflicts in listed files
# Then continue:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts for staging deployment"
git push origin staging

# Only use if you're certain about overwriting remote
git push --force-with-lease origin develop
git push --force-with-lease origin staging
