# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for MediaNest. ADRs document the architectural decisions made throughout the project's development, providing context, reasoning, and consequences for future reference.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows the standard format:

- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change we're proposing or have agreed to implement
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this decision

## Creating New ADRs

When making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create a new ADR file: `XXX-descriptive-title.md`
2. Follow the template structure
3. Number sequentially
4. Update this index
5. Get team review before marking as "Accepted"

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Context

[Describe the issue that motivates this decision or change]

## Decision

[Describe our response to these forces]

## Consequences

[Describe the resulting context, after applying the decision]
```

## Decision Status Guide

- **Proposed**: Decision is being considered but not yet agreed upon
- **Accepted**: Decision has been agreed upon and should be implemented
- **Deprecated**: Decision is no longer considered valid but not yet replaced
- **Superseded**: Decision has been replaced by a newer ADR
