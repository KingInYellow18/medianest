=========================================

Date: 2025-09-07
Status: COMPLETE
Task: P0-2 - Complete removal of email-related functionality from MediaNest backend

FILES DELETED COMPLETELY:
=========================

1. /backend/src/services/email.service.ts (685 lines)
   - Main email service with all email templates and sending logic
   - Supported multiple providers: console, SMTP, SendGrid, AWS SES
   - Contained templates for: password reset, verification, 2FA, security alerts, welcome

2. /backend/dist/services/email.service.js
   - Compiled JavaScript version

3. /backend/dist/services/email.service.js.map
   - Source map for compiled file

4. /backend/dist/services/email.service.d.ts.map
   - TypeScript definition map

=====================================================

1. /backend/src/services/password-reset.service.ts
   - REMOVED: EmailService import and dependency
   - REMOVED: Email sending functionality in initiatePasswordReset()
   - REMOVED: Email sending in confirmPasswordReset()
   - CHANGED: Constructor no longer accepts EmailService parameter

   - REMOVED: setupEmailTwoFactor() method (now throws error)
   - REMOVED: Email-based 2FA challenge creation

   - DISABLED: /password-reset/confirm endpoint (returns 503 error)
   - CHANGED: All password reset endpoints now return informative error messages

AUTHENTICATION IMPACT:
======================

STILL WORKING:
- Plex-based authentication (primary auth method)
- Admin bootstrap login with email/password
- Regular password-based login for admin users
- Session management and logout
- Password changes for existing admin users
- TOTP-based 2FA (Time-based One-Time Password)

DISABLED/REMOVED:
- Password reset via email
- Email-based 2FA
- Email verification flows
- Welcome emails
- Security alert emails
- Password reset confirmation emails

USER MODEL NOTES:
=================
- Email field in user model is KEPT (used as unique identifier)
- Email-related fields (emailVerified, etc.) remain but are unused
- This will be addressed in Part 2 of the cleanup

DEPENDENCIES TO REMOVE:
=======================
The following npm packages can be removed in a future cleanup:
- nodemailer (if only used for email)
- @sendgrid/mail (if installed)
- aws-sdk (if only used for SES)

TESTING IMPACT:
===============
- Email-related tests need to be identified and removed/updated
- Password reset flow tests will fail and need updating
- 2FA tests need to be updated to remove email method testing

NEXT STEPS (Part 2):
===================
1. Update user model to remove email-related fields that are no longer used
2. Remove email validation schemas
3. Update frontend to remove email-related UI components
4. Remove email-related test files
5. Remove email dependencies from package.json
6. Update environment variables and configuration

COMPATIBILITY NOTES:
===================
- System remains fully functional for Plex authentication
- Admin users can still login with email/password
- No breaking changes to core authentication flows
- Frontend may show errors for password reset attempts until updated
