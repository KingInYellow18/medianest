# MediaNest Technical Debt Audit Report

**Date:** January 19, 2025  
**Auditor:** Technical Debt Auditing Agent  
**Project:** MediaNest - Unified Media Server Portal  
**Version:** Phase 4 Complete (YouTube Integration)

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive technical debt audit reveals that MediaNest has **solid core functionality** but faces **critical testing and deployment readiness issues** that must be addressed before production deployment. The codebase demonstrates good architectural principles and security practices, but accumulated technical debt in testing infrastructure and deployment automation poses significant risks.

### Key Findings

- **Test Infrastructure Failure**: All backend tests are failing due to MSW v2 import issues
- **Low Test Coverage**: Estimated <20% coverage due to test failures
- **Security Gaps**: Missing SSL/TLS configuration and hardcoded secrets
- **Deployment Automation**: No CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- **Performance Optimization**: Limited code splitting and bundle optimization

### Production Readiness Score: 65/100

- âœ… Core Functionality: 90/100
- ðŸ”´ Testing: 20/100
- ðŸŸ¡ Security: 75/100
- ðŸŸ¡ Monitoring: 50/100
- ðŸŸ¡ Deployment: 60/100
- ðŸŸ¡ Documentation: 70/100

## Detailed Technical Debt Analysis

### 1. Code-Level Debt

#### Code Smells & Anti-patterns (Severity: MEDIUM)

**Issues Found:**

- 11 TODO comments indicating incomplete functionality
- Extensive console.log usage in production code
- Magic numbers and hardcoded values throughout codebase
- Some business logic in controllers instead of service layer

**Specific Examples:**

```typescript
// frontend/src/components/RequestFilters.tsx
// TODO: Implement date range picker

// backend/src/controllers/admin.controller.ts
const stats = await prisma.user.count(); // Business logic in controller
```

**Impact:**

- Development velocity: -10%
- Maintenance burden: Medium
- Bug potential: Medium

**Remediation:**

1. Replace console.log with proper logging service
2. Extract magic numbers to configuration constants
3. Move business logic to service layer
4. Complete TODO items or remove if not needed

#### Error Handling (Severity: LOW)

**Strengths:**

- Consistent AppError class usage
- User-friendly error messages
- Correlation IDs for tracing

**Gaps:**

- Missing error logging to external services (Sentry)
- Some unhandled promise rejections in WebSocket handlers

### 2. Architecture-Level Debt

#### Design Violations (Severity: LOW)

**Issues:**

- Minor separation of concerns violations in admin controller
- No formal dependency injection container
- Some direct Prisma calls in controllers

**Impact:**

- Testability: Slightly reduced
- Maintainability: Minor impact

#### Technology Debt (Severity: MEDIUM)

**Outdated Dependencies:**

- Next.js 14.2.30 (newer versions available)
- Some package version mismatches between workspaces
- No automated dependency update process

**Missing Abstractions:**

- No formal DI container for better testability
- Limited use of design patterns for complex operations

### 3. Testing Debt (Severity: CRITICAL)

#### Test Infrastructure Failure

**Critical Issue:**
All backend tests fail with: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'post')`

**Root Cause:**
MSW v2 breaking changes not addressed - import syntax needs updating from:

```typescript
import { rest } from 'msw';
```

to:

```typescript
import { http } from 'msw';
```

**Impact:**

- Cannot verify code changes
- No automated quality gates
- High risk of regression bugs
- Blocks CI/CD implementation

#### Coverage Gaps

**Current State:**

- Backend: ~10% (tests failing)
- Frontend: <5% (minimal tests)
- Shared: ~15% (basic tests)
- E2E: 0% (not implemented)

**Critical Untested Areas:**

1. Plex OAuth PIN flow
2. Media request workflow
3. Service monitoring
4. YouTube download process
5. User data isolation

### 4. Security Debt (Severity: HIGH)

#### Hardcoded Secrets

**Critical Findings:**

```javascript
// generate-secrets.js
password: 'medianest_password'; // Hardcoded

// backend config
defaultAdminPassword: 'admin'; // Hardcoded
```

#### Missing Security Features

- No SSL/TLS configuration (pending task)
- No secrets rotation strategy
- No automated security scanning in production
- Basic security headers only

### 5. Performance Debt (Severity: MEDIUM)

#### Bundle Size Optimization

**Issues:**

- Limited code splitting (only 7 files use dynamic imports)
- No lazy loading for heavy components
- Bundle analyzer configured but not used
- No automated performance testing

**Missing Optimizations:**

```typescript
// Should use dynamic imports
import ServiceCard from './ServiceCard'; // Heavy component

// Better:
const ServiceCard = lazy(() => import('./ServiceCard'));
```

#### Database Performance

**Missing Indexes:**

- `YoutubeDownload.status` - frequently queried
- `ServiceConfig.enabled` - used in status checks

**Potential N+1 Queries:**

- None detected (good Prisma usage)

### 6. Infrastructure & DevOps Debt (Severity: HIGH)

#### CI/CD Pipeline

**Implemented:**

- Basic GitHub Actions workflow
- Linting and type checking
- Docker build verification

**Missing:**

- Automated test execution (blocked by test failures)
- Coverage reporting
- Automated deployments
- Staging environment validation

#### Deployment Readiness

**Ready:**

- Docker containerization âœ…
- Health checks âœ…
- Environment configuration âœ…

**Missing:**

- SSL certificate configuration
- Backup/restore strategy
- Production deployment scripts
- Monitoring beyond basic metrics

### 7. Documentation Debt (Severity: LOW)

#### Positive Aspects

- Comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md
- Detailed CLAUDE.md for AI assistance
- Good inline code comments
- Clear API structure

#### Gaps

- No OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Missing ADRs (Architectural Decision Records)
- Outdated task tracking (completed tasks in pending folders)
- No runbooks for operations
