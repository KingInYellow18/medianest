# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This document contains architectural decisions made during the MediaNest implementation with their rationale and trade-offs.

## ADR-001: Centralized Configuration Management

### Status

**ACCEPTED** - Implemented in Phase 1

### Context

The MediaNest application consists of multiple workspaces (frontend, backend, shared) that need consistent configuration management. Previously, configuration was scattered across different files without validation or type safety.

### Decision

Implement a centralized configuration management system in the shared workspace with the following components:

1. **Zod-based Schema Validation**: Type-safe configuration schemas with runtime validation
2. **Environment Configuration Loader**: Hierarchical environment file loading with precedence rules
3. **Workspace Inheritance**: Common dependencies managed at root level with workspace inheritance
4. **Configuration Sections**: Modular configuration for database, Redis, logging, and external services

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Type-safe configuration with compile-time and runtime validation
- Consistent configuration across all workspaces
- Clear configuration precedence and loading order
- Reduced configuration drift between environments
- Better error messages for invalid configuration
- Centralized dependency version management

**Negative:**

- Initial migration effort required
- Additional abstraction layer
- Zod dependency added to shared package

### Implementation Details

```typescript
// Configuration loading hierarchy:
// 1. .env.defaults (lowest precedence)
// 2. .env
// 3. .env.{NODE_ENV}
// 4. .env.local
// 5. workspace-specific .env files
// 6. custom environment file (highest precedence)
```

## ADR-002: Structured Logging Architecture

### Status

**ACCEPTED** - Implemented in Phase 1

### Context

The application had inconsistent logging with console.log statements scattered throughout the codebase. This made debugging, monitoring, and log analysis difficult in production environments.

### Decision

Implement a centralized structured logging system with the following features:

1. **Winston-based Logging**: Industry-standard logging library with multiple transports
2. **Correlation ID Support**: Request tracing across services
3. **Log Levels**: Configurable log levels (error, warn, info, debug, verbose)
4. **Multiple Transports**: Console, file, and daily rotating file transports
5. **Structured Format**: JSON format for production, human-readable for development
6. **Child Loggers**: Context-aware logging with correlation IDs

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Consistent logging format across all services
- Better debugging with correlation IDs
- Structured logs for log aggregation systems
- Performance tracking capabilities
- Proper error handling and stack traces
- Log rotation and retention policies

**Negative:**

- Winston dependency added
- Need to replace all console.log statements
- Additional configuration complexity

### Implementation Details

```typescript
// Usage patterns:
const logger = createServiceLogger('backend');
const childLogger = createCorrelatedLogger(logger, correlationId);
const perfLogger = createPerformanceLogger(logger);

// All console.log replaced with structured logging
```

## ADR-003: Workspace Dependency Management Strategy

### Status

**ACCEPTED** - Implemented in Phase 1

### Context

The monorepo structure required consistent dependency management across workspaces while allowing flexibility for workspace-specific dependencies.

### Decision

Implement a hierarchical dependency management strategy:

1. **Root-level Common Dependencies**: Shared dependencies (zod, winston, axios, etc.) managed at root
2. **Workspace Inheritance**: Use "\*" version specifier to inherit from root
3. **Development Tools Centralization**: Common dev tools (TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier) at root
4. **Workspace-specific Dependencies**: Only workspace-unique dependencies in workspace package.json
5. **Version Consistency Checking**: Automated dependency consistency validation

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Consistent dependency versions across workspaces
- Reduced node_modules duplication
- Easier dependency updates
- Automatic version conflict detection
- Simplified dependency auditing

**Negative:**

- Less workspace autonomy for dependency versions
- Initial migration complexity
- Need for consistency checking tools

### Implementation Details

```json
// Root package.json - shared dependencies
{
  "dependencies": {
    "zod": "^3.23.8",
    "winston": "^3.13.1"
  }
}

// Workspace package.json - inherit from root
{
  "dependencies": {
    "zod": "*",
    "winston": "*"
  }
}
```

## ADR-004: Database Configuration Architecture

### Status

**ACCEPTED** - Implemented in Phase 1

### Context

Database connections needed centralized management with health checks, retry logic, and consistent configuration across different environments.

### Decision

Implement a centralized database configuration manager with:

1. **Prisma Client Management**: Centralized Prisma client creation and configuration
2. **Connection Health Checks**: Automated health monitoring with retry logic
3. **Multiple Client Support**: Named database clients for different purposes
4. **Configuration Validation**: Type-safe database configuration with Zod schemas
5. **Structured Logging Integration**: Database operation logging with correlation IDs
6. **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper connection cleanup on application shutdown

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Consistent database connection management
- Better error handling and recovery
- Health monitoring capabilities
- Multiple database support (if needed)
- Proper resource cleanup

**Negative:**

- Additional abstraction layer
- Prisma client wrapper complexity
- Memory overhead for client management

## ADR-005: Redis Configuration Architecture

### Status
