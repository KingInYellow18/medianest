- Service status indexes for dashboard queries

**Expected Performance Gain:** 40-60% reduction in query time

#### 1.2 Query Optimization Patterns

**Implementation Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

Optimized query patterns implemented in `/shared/src/utils/database-optimizations.ts`:

- Cursor-based pagination for better scalability

#### 2.2 Circuit Breaker Implementation

**Current Status:** Partially implemented with test failures

**Action Required:** Fix circuit breaker test failures and optimize error classification:

```typescript
// Circuit breaker configuration for external services
timeout: 5000,
errorThresholdPercentage: 50,
resetTimeout: 30000,
requestVolumeThreshold: 10
```

#### 2.3 Performance Monitoring Integration

**Implementation Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Phase 3: Frontend Bundle Optimization (Week 2)

#### 3.1 Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

**Current Status:** Basic implementation exists

**Optimization Targets:**

- Tree-shake unused dependencies
- Optimize bundle analyzer configuration

#### 3.2 Image and Asset Optimization

**Required Implementations:**

- Next.js Image component optimization
