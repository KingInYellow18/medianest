# MediaNest Documentation Migration Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for implementing the optimal documentation structure for MediaNest, consolidating 5,461 markdown files into ~150-200 well-organized documents.

## Quick Start

### 1. Review the Migration Plan

- **[Optimal Documentation Structure](OPTIMAL_DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md)** - Complete proposed structure
- **[File Mapping Details](DOCUMENTATION_MIGRATION_MAPPING.md)** - Detailed file-by-file mapping
- **[Migration Script](migrate-documentation.sh)** - Automated migration tool

### 2. Run the Migration Script

```bash
# Navigate to the docs directory
cd /home/kinginyellow/projects/medianest/docs

# Run the migration script
./migrate-documentation.sh
```

### 3. Post-Migration Tasks

The script handles initial migration, but manual work is needed for:

- Content consolidation and deduplication
- Link updating and cross-referencing
- Final content review and validation

## Migration Process Breakdown

### Phase 1: Automated Migration (Script Handles)

- ✅ Create new directory structure (14 main sections + archive)
- ✅ Backup original documentation to timestamped directory
- ✅ Migrate high-priority files with preservation notes
- ✅ Create template README files for each section
- ✅ Move archive materials to organized structure
- ✅ Generate initial cross-references
- ✅ Create migration report

### Phase 2: Content Consolidation (Manual)

After running the script, these tasks require manual attention:

#### 2.1 Large File Content Extraction

**Priority Files Requiring Manual Splitting:**

1. **`docs/API_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (55KB)**

   ```bash
   # Already migrated to: 03-api/README.md
   # Manual task: Extract sections to:
   # - 03-api/authentication.md (Auth sections)
   # - 03-api/media-management.md (Media API sections)
   # - 03-api/user-management.md (User API sections)
   # - 03-api/error-handling.md (Error handling sections)
   ```

2. **`docs/TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md` (63KB)**

   ```bash
   # Already migrated to: 06-testing/README.md
   # Manual task: Extract sections to:
   # - 06-testing/unit-testing.md (Unit testing sections)
   # - 06-testing/integration-testing.md (Integration sections)
   # - 06-testing/e2e-testing.md (E2E sections)
   # - 06-testing/mocking-strategies.md (MSW/mocking sections)
   ```

3. **`docs/SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE_STRATEGY.md` (55KB)**
   ```bash
   # Already migrated to: 08-security/README.md
   # Manual task: Extract sections to:
   # - 02-architecture/security-architecture.md (Architecture sections)
   # - 08-security/authentication-security.md (Auth security)
   # - 08-security/api-security.md (API security)
   # - 08-security/data-protection.md (Data protection)
   ```

#### 2.2 Testing Documentation Consolidation

**284 testing files → 7 consolidated files**

Manual consolidation needed for:

```bash
# Review and merge content from:
backend/tests/integration/README.md
backend/tests/integration/security/README.md
backend/tests/e2e/README.md
frontend/README-TESTING.md
# + 280 other testing files

# Into organized structure:
06-testing/README.md              # Strategy overview
06-testing/unit-testing.md        # Unit test patterns
06-testing/integration-testing.md # Integration strategies
06-testing/e2e-testing.md         # E2E testing guide
06-testing/test-data-management.md # Test fixtures
06-testing/mocking-strategies.md  # MSW/mocking patterns
06-testing/manual-testing-guide.md # Manual testing
```

#### 2.3 Deployment Documentation Consolidation

**33 deployment files → 9 consolidated files**

Key files to review and merge:

```bash
DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md → 07-deployment/docker-guide.md (done by script)
INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md → 07-deployment/local-development.md (done by script)
docs/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md → 07-deployment/production-deployment.md (done by script)

# Manual consolidation needed:
# - Multiple Docker configuration files
# - Various deployment environment docs
# - Infrastructure setup guides
# - SSL and security configuration docs
```

### Phase 3: Link Updates and Cross-References (Manual)

After content consolidation, update all internal references:

#### 3.1 Update Internal Links

```bash
# Find and update internal markdown links
grep -r "\[.*\](\.\./\|\./" docs/new-structure/ --include="*.md"

# Common patterns to update:
[API Guide](../docs/API_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)
# → [API Guide](../03-api/README.md)

[Testing](../TESTING.md)
# → [Testing](../06-testing/README.md)

[Deployment](../docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
# → [Deployment](../07-deployment/README.md)
```

#### 3.2 Add Cross-References

Add "Related Documentation" sections to each document:

```markdown
## Related Documentation

- [API Authentication](../03-api/authentication.md)
- [Security Architecture](../02-architecture/security-architecture.md)
- [Deployment Security](../07-deployment/production-deployment.md)
```

### Phase 4: Validation and Testing (Manual)

Final validation steps:

#### 4.1 Link Validation

```bash
# Check for broken internal links
find docs/new-structure -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "\[\.*\](" {} \; | xargs -I {} bash -c 'echo "Checking: {}"; grep -n "\[.*\](" "{}"'

# Validate external links (optional)
# Use tools like markdown-link-check or similar
```

#### 4.2 Content Completeness Review

- [ ] All critical information preserved
- [ ] No duplicate content across files
- [ ] Consistent formatting and structure
- [ ] All sections have proper README files
- [ ] Navigation flows logically
- [ ] Search functionality works (if implemented)

#### 4.3 Navigation Testing

Test documentation flows:

- [ ] Getting started → Installation → Development setup
- [ ] Architecture → API design → Implementation guides
- [ ] Testing overview → Specific testing strategies
- [ ] Deployment overview → Environment-specific guides
