- **Why**: Ensures core functionality is reliable before deployment
- **Time Estimate**: 8 hours
- **Key Work**:
  - Test Plex OAuth flow end-to-end
  - Test media request submission
  - Test YouTube download workflow
  - Test service status monitoring

### 2. **API Endpoint Testing** ðŸ”Œ

## Rationale for Phase 4 Focus

With all features implemented, the focus shifts to:

1. **Quality Assurance** - Ensuring everything works reliably
2. **Security** - Protecting user data and preventing abuse
3. **Performance** - Optimizing for the target 10-20 users
4. **Production Readiness** - Preparing for deployment
