### Phase 3 Tasks Updated Today

8. **08-plex-collection-browser.md** - Updated to COMPLETED âœ…
   - Collection browsing interface implemented at `/plex/collections`
   - Backend collection endpoints added to Plex controller
   - Supports filtering by search, sorting, and minimum item count
   - Collection detail view with items display

### Phase 3 Tasks Still Pending

1. **15-download-plex-integration.md** - Not Started
   - Integration to trigger Plex library scans after YouTube downloads
   - Collection creation for YouTube channels

## Next 3 Tasks to Work On (Can Be Done in Parallel)

### 1. **Phase 3: Task 15 - YouTube to Plex Integration** ðŸ”„

- **File**: `tasks/phase3/15-download-plex-integration.md`
- **Why**: Completes the YouTube download workflow
- **Dependencies**: YouTube downloads already working, just needs Plex integration
- **Time Estimate**: 4 hours
- **Key Work**:
  - Add Plex library scan triggering after downloads
  - Implement collection creation for YouTube channels
  - Update download processor to notify Plex

### 2. **Phase 4: Task 01 - Critical Path Testing** ðŸ§ª

- **File**: `tasks/phase4/01-critical-path-testing.md`
- **Why**: Ensures core functionality is reliable before deployment
- **Dependencies**: Most features already implemented
- **Time Estimate**: 8 hours
- **Key Work**:
  - Test Plex OAuth flow end-to-end
  - Test media request submission
  - Test YouTube download workflow
  - Test service status monitoring

### 3. **Phase 4: Task 02 - Performance Optimization** âš¡

- **File**: `tasks/phase4/02-performance-optimization.md`
- **Why**: Ensures smooth user experience
- **Dependencies**: All major features implemented
- **Time Estimate**: 6 hours
- **Key Work**:
  - Implement lazy loading for media grids
  - Add caching strategies
  - Optimize bundle size
  - Database query optimization

## Rationale for Task Selection

These three tasks can be worked on in parallel because:

1. **YouTube to Plex Integration** - Backend work focused on the download processor
2. **Critical Path Testing** - Testing work that can begin immediately for already-implemented features
3. **Performance Optimization** - Frontend/backend optimization work

All three tasks:

- Have minimal dependencies on each other
- Cover different parts of the codebase (frontend/backend/testing)
- Move the project closer to MVP completion
- Are high-priority for a complete user experience

## Current Implementation Status

### Phase Completion Status:

- âœ… Phase 0: Project Setup - COMPLETE
- âœ… Phase 1: Core Foundation - COMPLETE
- âœ… Phase 2: External Service Integration - COMPLETE
- ðŸš§ Phase 3: Feature Implementation - 93% COMPLETE (14/15 tasks)
- ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: Production Readiness - NOT STARTED
- ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Launch Preparation - NOT STARTED

### Key Achievements:

- All core infrastructure is in place
- Authentication, API, and security layers complete
- External service integrations (Plex, Overseerr, Uptime Kuma) working
- Most UI features implemented
- YouTube download system fully functional

### Remaining for MVP:

- 1 Phase 3 task (YouTube to Plex integration)
- Phase 4 testing and optimization
- Phase 5 deployment preparation
