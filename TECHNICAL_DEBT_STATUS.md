## Technical Debt Prevention Guidelines

### Code Reviews

- Enforce naming conventions
- Prevent console.log in production code
- Require tests for new features
- Document breaking changes

### Development Standards

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow ESLint rules
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage
- Document all public APIs

### File Management

- No temporary file suffixes (_-fixed, _-old, etc.)
- Use git for version control, not file copies
- Keep configurations DRY
- Co-locate related code
