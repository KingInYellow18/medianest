# MediaNest Security Audit Report

**Date**: December 2024  
**Audit Type**: Comprehensive Security Review  
**Scope**: Authentication, Authorization, Data Protection, Infrastructure Security

## Executive Summary

The MediaNest application demonstrates strong security fundamentals with modern security practices implemented across most layers. The audit identified **3 critical issues** that require immediate attention, along with several medium and low-severity findings that should be addressed to strengthen the overall security posture.

**Overall Security Score: 8/10**

## Critical Findings (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Hardcoded Secret Fallbacks

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Location**: `backend/src/services/jwt.service.ts`, `backend/src/socket/middleware.ts`  
**Risk**: Predictable JWT secrets could allow authentication bypass

**Current Code**:

```typescript
// JWT Service
this.secret = config.jwt?.secret || 'fallback-secret';

// Socket Middleware
jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET || 'your-secret-key');
```

**Recommendation**: Remove all fallback secrets. Application should fail to start if secrets are missing.

### 2. Static Encryption Salt

**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Location**: `backend/src/services/encryption.service.ts`  
**Risk**: Static salt weakens encryption, making rainbow table attacks possible

**Current Code**:

```typescript
this.key = crypto.scryptSync(encryptionKey, 'salt', 32);
```

**Recommendation**: Generate random salt for each encryption operation and store it with the encrypted data.

### 3. Missing CSRF Protection

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Risk**: Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks possible on state-changing operations

**Recommendation**: Implement CSRF tokens for all POST/PUT/DELETE operations.

## High-Priority Findings

### 1. Overly Permissive Content Security Policy

**Severity**: HIGH  
**Location**: `backend/src/middleware/security.middleware.ts`

Current CSP allows `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` which weakens XSS protection.

**Recommendation**:

- Remove `'unsafe-inline'` and use nonces for inline scripts
- Remove `'unsafe-eval'` and refactor any dynamic code execution
- Implement strict CSP for production

### 2. Missing WebSocket Rate Limiting

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Risk**: DoS attacks possible through WebSocket connections

**Recommendation**: Implement connection and message rate limiting for Socket.io

### 3. Insufficient Password Policy

**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Current**: 12 character minimum  
**Recommendation**: Increase to 14-16 characters minimum

## Security Strengths

### ✅ Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication properly implemented
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with admin/user separation
- Plex OAuth integration with secure PIN flow
- Session validation and token expiry handling

### ✅ Data Protection

- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
- Proper IV and auth tag handling
- Encrypted storage of API keys and tokens
- No sensitive data in logs (properly sanitized)

### ✅ Input Validation

- Comprehensive Zod schemas for all endpoints
- Type-safe validation with TypeScript
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities (Prisma ORM)
- Proper error messages without information leakage

### ✅ Rate Limiting

- Redis-based rate limiting with atomic Lua scripts
- Differentiated limits for various operations
- Graceful degradation on Redis failure
- Proper rate limit headers

### ✅ Infrastructure Security

- Docker containers run as non-root user
- Secrets management via Docker secrets
- Health checks for all services
- Network isolation between services

## Medium-Priority Recommendations

### 1. Enhance Cookie Security

Configure cookies with security flags:

```typescript
{
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,        // HTTPS only
  sameSite: 'strict',  // CSRF protection
  maxAge: 86400000     // 24 hours
}
```

### 2. Implement Security Headers

Add additional headers:

- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()`

### 3. Add Security Event Logging

Implement audit logging for:

- Failed authentication attempts
- Authorization failures
- Rate limit violations
- Configuration changes

### 4. Implement API Versioning Deprecation

Document API deprecation policy and sunset timelines.

## Low-Priority Enhancements

### 1. Consider Refresh Token Rotation

Implement refresh token rotation for enhanced security.

### 2. Add 2FA for Admin Accounts

Implement TOTP-based two-factor authentication for administrative users.

### 3. Implement Security Headers Documentation

Create comprehensive documentation for all security headers and their purposes.

### 4. Add API Key Management

Implement API key generation and management for service-to-service authentication.

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR Compliance

- ✅ Data encryption at rest
- ✅ User consent through Plex OAuth
- ⚠️ Missing data deletion procedures
- ⚠️ No audit trail for data access

### Security Best Practices

- ✅ OWASP Top 10 protections mostly implemented
- ✅ Secure coding practices followed
- ✅ Dependency management with npm audit
- ⚠️ Missing security testing in CI/CD

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing

1. Add security-focused unit tests
2. Implement integration tests for auth flows
3. Add penetration testing for critical paths
4. Use OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning

### Test Coverage

- Current: ~70% overall
- Target: 80% for security-critical code
- Focus on: Authentication, encryption, rate limiting

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1 (Critical)

- [ ] Remove hardcoded secret fallbacks
- [ ] Implement random salt for encryption
- [ ] Add CSRF protection

### Week 2 (High Priority)

- [ ] Tighten CSP policy
- [ ] Add WebSocket rate limiting
- [ ] Update password policy

### Week 3 (Medium Priority)

- [ ] Enhance cookie security
- [ ] Implement security event logging
- [ ] Add missing security headers

### Week 4 (Low Priority)

## Conclusion

MediaNest demonstrates a security-conscious design with most modern security practices already implemented. The critical issues identified are straightforward to fix and, once addressed, will significantly strengthen the application's security posture. The use of established libraries (Helmet, Prisma, Zod) provides a solid security foundation.

For a small-scale media management application serving 10-20 users, the current security implementation is appropriate once the critical issues are resolved. The recommended enhancements will provide defense-in-depth and prepare the application for potential future scaling.
