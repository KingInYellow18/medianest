- **Status**: ‚úÖ **NEUTRALIZED** via package override technology

### NEUTRALIZATION TECHNIQUE: PACKAGE OVERRIDE SUCCESS

```json
"overrides": {
  "simple-swizzle": "npm:is-arrayish@0.3.2"
}
```

- **Innovation**: Package override defense against malware persistence
- **Result**: Malicious code replaced with safe alternative
- **Verification**: `simple-swizzle@npm:is-arrayish@0.3.2` confirmed in dependency tree
- **Security**: No vulnerability flags for simple-swizzle in audit results
