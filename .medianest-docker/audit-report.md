## 🛠️ CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 🔐 Security Vulnerabilities Resolved

1. **FIXED: Hardcoded Database Passwords**
   - ❌ Before: `medianest_password` in plaintext
   - ✅ After: Docker secrets with `_FILE` environment variables
   - 📁 File: `docker-compose.secure.yml`

2. **FIXED: Exposed Database Ports**
   - ❌ Before: PostgreSQL/Redis exposed to host
   - ✅ After: Internal network access only
   - 🔒 Security: Prevents direct database attacks

3. **FIXED: Missing Redis Authentication**
   - ❌ Before: No password protection
   - ✅ After: Password-protected with Docker secrets
   - 🛡️ Security: Authentication required for access

### 🆕 New Components Created

#### 1. **Secure Docker Compose** (`docker-compose.secure.yml`)

```yaml
# Enterprise-grade security configuration
- Docker secrets for all sensitive data
- Network isolation and port binding
- Resource limits and security constraints
- Health checks and monitoring
```

#### 2. **Docker Secrets Setup** (`scripts/setup-docker-secrets.sh`)

```bash
# Automated secret generation and management
- Generates cryptographically secure secrets
- Initializes Docker Swarm if needed
- Creates versioned secrets for rotation
- Comprehensive secret lifecycle management
```
