### 🎨 Test Architecture & Design

#### Test Pattern Standards
- **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern consistently applied
- **Component stub testing** for placeholder components
- **Future-extensible tests** prepared for real implementations
- **Accessibility testing** considerations included
- **Error boundary testing** patterns established

#### Mock Strategy
- **Socket.io-client** - Comprehensive mock with event handling
- **Fetch API** - Flexible mock with URL-based responses
- **File API** - MockFile implementation for upload testing
- **Chart.js** - Visualization library mocking

#### Test Categories Per Component
1. **Basic Rendering** - Ensures components mount without errors
2. **Props Acceptance** - Validates custom props don't break components
3. **CSS Classes** - Verifies styling structure
4. **Future Implementation** - Extensible tests for real functionality
5. **User Interactions** - Event handling patterns (future-ready)
6. **Error States** - Error boundary and graceful failure testing
7. **Accessibility** - ARIA attributes and semantic HTML validation

### 📈 Code Coverage Targets

#### Achievable Coverage (Current Stub Implementation)
- **Statements**: ~95% (stub components are simple)
- **Branches**: ~85% (limited conditional logic in stubs)  
- **Functions**: ~100% (all component functions exported)
- **Lines**: ~95% (comprehensive test coverage)

#### Future Coverage (Real Implementation)
- **Target**: 75%+ across all metrics
- **Focus Areas**: User interactions, error states, edge cases
- **Testing Strategy**: TDD approach for new features
