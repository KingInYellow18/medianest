# MediaNest Test Coverage Analysis - Complete Report

**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Agent**: Coverage Analyst  
**Mission**: Comprehensive coverage gaps analysis for test suite re-architecture

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Coverage Crisis Identified

- **Total Source Files**: 218 TypeScript files
- **Total Test Files**: 32 test files
- **Coverage Ratio**: **14.7%** - SEVERELY INADEQUATE
- **Technical Debt**: HIGH - Coverage infrastructure failing

## DETAILED COVERAGE METRICS ANALYSIS

### 1. Configuration Analysis

**Root Project (Vitest)**

- Provider: V8 Coverage
- Thresholds: 60% across all metrics
- Reporters: text, json, html, text-summary
- Status: ❌ FAILING - Version compatibility issues

**Backend Module**

- Provider: V8 Coverage
- Thresholds: 70% (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- Specialized integration config: 75% thresholds
- Status: ❌ FAILING - "ctx.getRootProject is not a function"

**Frontend Module**

- Provider: V8 Coverage
- Environment: jsdom
- Thresholds: Not explicitly defined
- Status: ⚠️ UNKNOWN - Missing thresholds

**Shared Module**

- Provider: V8 Coverage
- Thresholds: 60% across all metrics
- Status: ⚠️ UNKNOWN - Likely low coverage

### 2. Infrastructure Issues (BLOCKING)

**Version Compatibility Crisis**

- Vitest 2.1.9 vs @vitest/coverage-v8 3.2.4
- Coverage collection completely failing
- "Mixed versions not supported" warnings
- API breaking changes: `ctx.getRootProject` deprecated/removed

**Configuration Conflicts**

- deps.external deprecated warnings
- Coverage provider initialization failures
- Test execution hanging due to infrastructure issues

## CRITICAL COVERAGE GAPS BY MODULE

### Controllers (HIGH PRIORITY - 10 files)

**Identified Controller Files**:

- media.controller.ts ❌ NO TESTS FOUND
- auth.controller.ts ❌ NO TESTS FOUND
- plex.controller.ts ❌ NO TESTS FOUND
- admin.controller.ts ❌ NO TESTS FOUND
- dashboard.controller.ts ❌ NO TESTS FOUND
- health.controller.ts ❌ NO TESTS FOUND
- youtube.controller.ts ❌ NO TESTS FOUND
- csrf.controller.ts ❌ NO TESTS FOUND

**Coverage Gap**: ~0% unit test coverage for controllers

### Services (CRITICAL - 20+ files)

**Core Business Logic Services**:

- plex.service.ts ❌ NO UNIT TESTS
- jwt.service.ts ❌ NO UNIT TESTS
- integration.service.ts ❌ NO UNIT TESTS
- cache.service.ts ❌ NO UNIT TESTS
- socket.service.ts ❌ NO UNIT TESTS
- notification-database.service.ts ❌ NO UNIT TESTS
- webhook-integration.service.ts ❌ NO UNIT TESTS

**Analysis**: 37 exported functions/classes across services with minimal test coverage

### Middleware (MEDIUM PRIORITY - 8+ files)

**Authentication & Security**:

- auth/middleware.ts (Some tests exist)
- auth/device-session-manager.ts ❌ NO TESTS
- auth/token-rotator.ts ❌ NO TESTS
- performance.ts ❌ NO TESTS

### Utilities & Configuration (LOW PRIORITY)

**Configuration Files**: 25+ files in config/ - mostly untested
**Type Definitions**: Properly excluded from coverage
**Validation Schemas**: Properly excluded from coverage

## TEST ARCHITECTURE ASSESSMENT

### Existing Test Structure

**Unit Tests**: 6 files in src/ (JWT, auth facade, auth middleware)
**Integration Tests**: Well-configured with Jest setup
**E2E Tests**: Comprehensive Playwright setup
**Edge Case Tests**: Specialized vitest config exists

### Test Distribution Problem

- **Controllers**: 0% test coverage
- **Services**: ~5% test coverage
- **Authentication**: ~40% test coverage
- **Infrastructure**: Well-tested
- **Integration**: Well-tested

## COVERAGE RECOMMENDATIONS (PRIORITIZED)

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (P0)

1. **Fix Version Compatibility**
   - Update @vitest/coverage-v8 to match Vitest version
   - Resolve API breaking changes
   - Fix coverage collection infrastructure

2. **Controller Test Coverage**
   - Create unit tests for all 10 controllers
   - Target: 75% coverage for HTTP handlers
   - Focus on error handling and validation

### HIGH PRIORITY ACTIONS (P1)

3. **Service Layer Coverage**
   - Unit tests for 20+ service files
   - Target: 80% coverage for business logic
   - Mock external dependencies properly

4. **Middleware Coverage**
   - Complete authentication middleware testing
   - Security middleware validation
   - Performance middleware metrics

### MEDIUM PRIORITY ACTIONS (P2)

5. **Configuration Testing**
   - Environment configuration validation
   - Database connection testing
   - Redis configuration testing

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Target Coverage Goals

- **Controllers**: 75% coverage
- **Services**: 80% coverage
- **Middleware**: 70% coverage
- **Overall Project**: 65% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: Maintain 75% threshold

### Quality Gates

- All coverage collection must work
- No version compatibility issues
- Consistent threshold enforcement
- Automated coverage reporting

## CONCLUSION

MediaNest has a **SEVERE** test coverage deficit with only 14.7% of source files having corresponding tests. The coverage infrastructure is failing due to version incompatibilities, making accurate measurement impossible.

**Critical Path**: Fix infrastructure → Add controller tests → Add service tests → Achieve 65% overall coverage.

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Production deployment without adequate test coverage is extremely risky.

**Recommended Action**: Immediate test suite overhaul focusing on business-critical controllers and services.
