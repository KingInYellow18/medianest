# MediaNest Consolidated Docker Architecture Design

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Consolidate 10+ Dockerfiles and 11+ docker-compose files into a unified, maintainable architecture with zero functionality loss and optimized build performance.

**Current State Analysis**:

- **Dockerfiles**: 10 variations (main, optimized, performance-v2, production-secure, test, quick, simple, etc.)
- **Compose Files**: 11 configurations (dev, prod, production-secure, hardened, test, optimized, etc.)
- **Build Performance Issues**: Sequential builds, cache inefficiency, security warnings
- **Maintenance Complexity**: High cognitive overhead, configuration drift risk

## Consolidated Architecture Design

### 1. Single Multi-Stage Dockerfile Strategy

**Target Dockerfile Structure**:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7-labs
# MediaNest Unified Multi-Stage Build - All Environments

ARG NODE_VERSION=20
ARG ALPINE_VERSION=3.19
ARG BUILD_TARGET=production

# Stage 1: Dependencies & Cache Optimization
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-alpine${ALPINE_VERSION} AS deps-base

# Stage 2: Shared Package Build (Parallel)
FROM deps-base AS shared-builder

# Stage 3: Backend Build (Parallel)
FROM deps-base AS backend-builder

# Stage 4: Frontend Build (Parallel)
FROM deps-base AS frontend-builder

# Stage 5: Production Backend
FROM deps-base AS backend-production

# Stage 6: Production Frontend
FROM deps-base AS frontend-production

# Stage 7: Development (Full stack)
FROM deps-base AS development

# Stage 8: Testing Environment
FROM deps-base AS testing
```

### 2. Three-Tier Compose Strategy

**Tier 1: Base Configuration** (`docker-compose.base.yml`)

- Core service definitions
- Common network/volume configurations
- Base environment variables
- Health checks and restart policies

**Tier 2: Environment Overrides**

- `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development-specific overrides
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production-specific overrides
- `docker-compose.test.yml` - Testing-specific overrides

**Tier 3: Security & Performance Profiles**

- `docker-compose.security.yml` - Security hardening overlay
- `docker-compose.performance.yml` - Performance optimization overlay
- `docker-compose.monitoring.yml` - Observability overlay

### 3. BuildKit Optimization Strategy

**Parallel Build Architecture**:

- Shared, Backend, Frontend stages run concurrently
- Advanced cache mount strategies
- Multi-platform build support
- Dependency layer optimization

**Cache Strategy**:

- Node modules cache: `/root/.npm`
- Build artifacts cache: `/app/*/node_modules/.cache`
- Prisma engines cache: `/tmp/prisma-engines`
- Build context optimization

### 4. Environment-Specific Configurations

**Development Environment**:

- Hot reload support
- Debug ports exposed
- Development dependencies included
- Volume mounts for source code
- Relaxed security constraints

**Production Environment**:

- Minimal attack surface
- Read-only filesystem where possible
- Security hardening (no-new-privileges, capability drops)
- Resource constraints and limits
- Health monitoring and logging

**Testing Environment**:

- Isolated test databases
- Coverage reporting
- E2E test support
- Parallel test execution

### 5. Security Architecture Decisions

**Security-First Design**:

- Non-root users for all services
- Docker secrets management
- Network segmentation (internal/public networks)
- Read-only filesystem with controlled write access
- Capability dropping and security opts

**Secrets Management**:

- External Docker secrets for production
- Environment variables for development
- Encrypted at rest and in transit
- Rotation capabilities built-in

## Performance Targets

**Build Performance**:

- Target build time: <3 minutes (vs current 8-12 minutes)
- Cache hit rate: >80%
- Parallel execution: 3-4 concurrent stages
- Image size: <200MB per service (vs current 400MB+)

**Runtime Performance**:

- Memory usage: Backend <512MB, Frontend <256MB
- CPU limits: Backend 1.0 CPU, Frontend 0.5 CPU
- Startup time: <30 seconds full stack
- Health check response: <5 seconds

## Migration Strategy

**Phase 1: Unified Dockerfile** (Week 1)

- Create consolidated Dockerfile.unified
- Test all target builds (dev/prod/test)
- Validate functionality parity
- Performance benchmark comparison

**Phase 2: Base Compose** (Week 1)

- Extract common configurations to base compose
- Create environment-specific overlays
- Test compose combinations
- Validate service connectivity

**Phase 3: Legacy Deprecation** (Week 2)

- Update CI/CD pipelines
- Update documentation
- Remove legacy Docker files
- Final validation and rollout

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Single Dockerfile with Multi-Stage Builds

**Decision**: Use single Dockerfile with multiple targets instead of separate files
**Rationale**: Reduces maintenance overhead, ensures consistency, enables shared layer optimization
**Consequences**: More complex Dockerfile, but centralized control and better cache efficiency

### ADR-002: Three-Tier Compose Strategy

**Decision**: Base + Environment Overrides + Profile Overlays
**Rationale**: Balances flexibility with maintainability, follows DRY principles
**Consequences**: Requires understanding of compose override mechanism, but reduces duplication

### ADR-003: BuildKit Advanced Features

**Decision**: Use BuildKit syntax and advanced cache mounts
**Rationale**: Significant performance gains through parallelization and caching
**Consequences**: Requires Docker 20.10+, but 2-4x build speed improvement

### ADR-004: Security-by-Default

**Decision**: Implement security hardening in base configuration
**Rationale**: Production readiness and compliance requirements
**Consequences**: Additional complexity, but enhanced security posture

## Implementation Priority Matrix

**P0 - Critical**:

- Unified Dockerfile creation
- Base compose configuration
- Build performance optimization
- Security hardening validation

**P1 - High**:

- Environment-specific overlays
- Legacy file deprecation
- CI/CD pipeline updates
- Documentation updates

**P2 - Medium**:

- Monitoring overlay
- Advanced cache strategies
- Multi-platform builds
- Performance profiling

**P3 - Low**:

- Developer tooling integration
- Advanced debugging features
- Custom build optimization
- Extended monitoring metrics

## Success Metrics

**Technical Metrics**:

- Build time reduction: >60%
- Image size reduction: >40%
- Cache hit rate: >80%
- Configuration files: <5 (from 21+)

**Operational Metrics**:

- Developer onboarding time: <30 minutes
- Deployment success rate: 100%
- Configuration drift incidents: 0
- Security vulnerabilities: 0 high/critical

## Risk Mitigation

**Build Compatibility Risk**:

- Comprehensive testing across all environments
- Parallel legacy support during transition
- Automated validation pipelines
- Rollback procedures documented

**Performance Regression Risk**:

- Baseline performance benchmarks
- A/B testing methodology
- Performance monitoring integration
- Gradual rollout strategy

**Security Risk**:

- Security scanning integration
- Penetration testing validation
- Compliance checklist verification
- Incident response procedures

This consolidated architecture design provides a path to significantly reduce complexity while improving performance, security, and maintainability of the MediaNest Docker infrastructure.
