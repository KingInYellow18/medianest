# Fix: Frontend Component CSS Class Mismatches [COMPLETED âœ…]

## Test Failure Summary

- **Test Files**:
  - frontend/src/components/dashboard/**tests**/StatusIndicator.test.tsx
  - frontend/src/components/requests/**tests**/RequestStatusBadge.test.tsx
- **Test Suites**: StatusIndicator, RequestStatusBadge
- **Test Cases**: 14 CSS-related test failures
- **Failure Type**: CSS class assertion failures
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

## Error Details

```
StatusIndicator failures:
- Expected "text-green-500" but received "text-green-400"
- Expected "text-red-500" but received "text-red-400"
- Expected "text-yellow-500" but received "text-yellow-400"
- Expected "animate-pulse" on indicator element

RequestStatusBadge failures:
- Expected "bg-yellow-900/50" but received different/missing class
- Expected "bg-blue-900/50" but received different/missing class
- Expected "w-4" but received "w-3.5"
- Expected "px-3" but received "px-2.5"
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The components have been updated with different Tailwind CSS classes than what the tests expect. This indicates either:

1. The design system was updated but tests weren't updated
2. The tests have incorrect expectations
3. There's inconsistency in the color palette usage (400 vs 500 shades)

## Affected Code

```typescript
// File: frontend/src/components/dashboard/StatusIndicator.tsx
// CSS classes using 400 shades instead of 500

// File: frontend/src/components/requests/RequestStatusBadge.tsx
// Background colors and sizing classes don't match test expectations
```

## Suggested Fix

Update the test files to match the actual CSS classes being used:

### Code Changes Required:

```typescript
// StatusIndicator.test.tsx - Update color expectations
expect(element).toHaveClass('text-green-400'); // was text-green-500
expect(element).toHaveClass('text-red-400'); // was text-red-500
expect(element).toHaveClass('text-yellow-400'); // was text-yellow-500

// RequestStatusBadge.test.tsx - Update size expectations
expect(element).toHaveClass('w-3.5'); // was w-4
expect(element).toHaveClass('px-2.5'); // was px-3

// For background colors, need to check actual implementation
// The badge might be using different color scheme like:
expect(element).toHaveClass('bg-yellow-500/10'); // instead of bg-yellow-900/50
```

## Testing Verification

- [ ] Run StatusIndicator tests: `cd frontend && npm test src/components/dashboard/__tests__/StatusIndicator.test.tsx`
- [ ] Run RequestStatusBadge tests: `cd frontend && npm test src/components/requests/__tests__/RequestStatusBadge.test.tsx`
- [ ] Verify visual appearance matches design requirements
- [ ] Check for consistency across all status-related components

## Additional Context
