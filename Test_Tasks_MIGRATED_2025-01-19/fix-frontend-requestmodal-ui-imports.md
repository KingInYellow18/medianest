# Fix: RequestModal Component UI Import Errors [COMPLETED âœ…]

## Test Failure Summary

- **Test File**: frontend/src/components/media/**tests**/RequestModal.test.tsx
- **Test Suite**: RequestModal
- **Test Cases**: 12 out of 13 tests failing
- **Failure Type**: Element type invalid - missing component imports
- **Priority**: CRITICAL

## Error Details

```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Check your code at RequestModal.tsx:81.
Check your code at RequestModal.tsx:60.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The RequestModal component is using UI components that are either:

1. Not properly imported from the UI library
2. Using incorrect import paths
3. Missing from the UI component exports

The errors specifically point to lines 60 and 81 in RequestModal.tsx where undefined components are being used.

## Affected Code

```typescript
// File: frontend/src/components/media/RequestModal.tsx
// Lines: 60, 81
// Need to check what UI components are being used at these lines
```

## Suggested Fix

Based on the pattern, the component is likely using Dialog-related UI components. Need to:

1. Check the UI library imports at the top of RequestModal.tsx
2. Verify all Dialog-related components are properly imported
3. Ensure the import paths match the actual UI component structure

### Code Changes Required:

```typescript
// Ensure proper imports from UI library
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogContent,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogFooter,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
} from '@/components/ui/dialog';

// Or if using a different structure:
import { Dialog } from '@/components/ui/dialog';
// And access sub-components as Dialog.Content, Dialog.Title, etc.
```

## Testing Verification

- [ ] Run the specific test: `cd frontend && npm test src/components/media/__tests__/RequestModal.test.tsx`
- [ ] Verify all 13 tests in the RequestModal suite pass
- [ ] Check that no TypeScript errors exist in RequestModal.tsx
- [ ] Ensure the modal renders correctly in the browser

## Additional Context

- Related files: frontend/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx (if it exists)
- Dependencies: Check if @radix-ui/react-dialog is installed
- Previous similar issues: Other components may have similar import issues
