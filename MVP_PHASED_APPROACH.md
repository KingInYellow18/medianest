# MediaNest MVP Phased Approach

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Status:** Planning Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a phased approach to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for MediaNest. The strategy focuses on delivering core value early while building on a solid technical foundation. The entire MVP can be completed in approximately 9 weeks with a single developer or 5-6 weeks with a small team.

## Core MVP Principles

1. **User Value First**: Each phase must deliver tangible value to end users
2. **Technical Foundation**: Build security, performance, and reliability from the start
3. **Iterative Development**: Ship working features early and improve incrementally
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Address technical uncertainties and integrations early
5. **Feedback Loops**: Enable user testing and feedback collection throughout

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Duration | Core Deliverables | User Value |
|-------|----------|-------------------|------------|
| Phase 1 | 2 weeks | Authentication, Infrastructure | Secure login with Plex |
| Phase 2 | 2 weeks | Dashboard, Media Browsing | View content and service status |
| Phase 3 | 2 weeks | Requests, YouTube Downloads | Request media, download playlists |
| Phase 4 | 2 weeks | Polish, Testing, Optimization | Fast, reliable experience |
| Phase 5 | 1 week | Deployment, Documentation | Production-ready system |
