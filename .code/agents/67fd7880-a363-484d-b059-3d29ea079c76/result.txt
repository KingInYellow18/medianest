Of course. Here is a comprehensive, phased audit plan designed to analyze the MediaNest repository for bugs, architectural compliance, performance, security, and requirements gaps. This plan leverages the existing tools and conventions found within the project.

First, I will conduct a brief exploration of the repository to confirm the location of key configuration and documentation files. This will ensure the audit plan is well-grounded in the project's actual structure.Excellent. Based on the file exploration and the detailed request, here is the comprehensive, multi-phase audit plan for the MediaNest repository.

# MediaNest Comprehensive Audit Plan

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a prioritized, multi-phase audit of the MediaNest platform. The goal is to identify and address issues related to correctness, architectural integrity, performance, security, and requirements coverage. The audit is designed to be executed by the engineering team, leveraging existing tools and processes.

**Owners/Stakeholders:**
*   **Audit Lead:** Engineering Manager
*   **Phase Owners:** Tech Leads (Backend, Frontend)
*   **Consultants:** Security Team, QA Lead

## 2. Required Environments & Services

*   **Local Development Environment:** A developer machine configured per `DEVELOPMENT.md`, with access to Node.js, Docker, and a local instance of PostgreSQL and Redis.
*   **CI/CD Environment:** The existing CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) which has access to all necessary services and secrets.
*   **Staging Environment:** A deployed, production-like environment for E2E, performance, and security validation.

## 3. Audit Phases

The audit is broken into three prioritized phases:

*   **Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-3 Days):** Establish a baseline and identify immediate risks.
*   **Phase 2: Short Sprint (1-2 Weeks):** Conduct a deeper analysis of the application's core components.
*   **Phase 3: Deep Program (1-2 Months):** Perform a comprehensive, in-depth review of the entire system.

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Duration: 1-3 Days)

**Goal:** Identify low-hanging fruit, establish a project health baseline, and catch critical regressions or vulnerabilities without deep analysis.

| Task | Description | Commands & Tools | Acceptance Criteria | Artifacts | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **1.1: Static Analysis & Linting** | Ensure code conforms to style guides and identify basic code quality issues. | `npm install`<br>`npm run lint` | Zero linting errors or warnings. | `lint-report.txt` | Dev Team |
| **1.2: Dependency Vulnerability Scan** | Scan all dependencies (`npm`, `docker`) for known vulnerabilities. | `npm audit --audit-level=high`<br>`docker scan <image_name>` | Zero critical or high-severity vulnerabilities. | `npm-audit.json`<br>`docker-scan.json` | Audit Lead |
| **1.3: Unit & Fast Test Execution** | Run all fast/unit tests to confirm core logic is functioning as expected. | `npm run test:ultra-fast` | 100% pass rate. | Test execution logs. | Dev Team |
| **1.4: Configuration Review** | Manually inspect `.env.example` and key config files (`backend/src/config`) for default credentials, insecure settings, or missing secrets. | Manual Review | All default secrets are placeholders; no sensitive information is exposed. | `config-review.md` | Security Team |
| **1.5: Documentation Health Check** | Verify that key documentation exists and is accessible. | `ls -R docs/`<br>Read `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SECURITY_HARDENING_COMPLETE.md` | Key documents are present and readable. | Documentation Index | Audit Lead |

---

### Phase 2: Short Sprint (Duration: 1-2 Weeks)

**Goal:** Dive deeper into the application's architecture, integration points, and performance characteristics.

| Task | Description | Commands & Tools | Acceptance Criteria | Artifacts | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2.1: Architectural Compliance Review** | Manually review backend (`app.ts`, routes, services) and frontend structure against `ARCHITECTURE.md`. | Manual Code Review | No major deviations from the documented architecture. A list of identified deviations is created. | `architectural-compliance-report.md` | Tech Leads |
| **2.2: Full Test Suite Execution** | Run the complete test suite, including integration and backend security tests. | `npm test`<br>`npm run test:integration`<br>`npm run test:security` | >=95% pass rate. Coverage meets the CI threshold (>=65%). | `test-coverage-report.html`<br>`test-results.xml` | QA Lead |
| **2.3: Backend Performance Baseline** | Execute backend performance tests to establish a baseline for API response times under normal load. | `npm run test:performance` | Performance benchmarks are recorded. No single endpoint exceeds a 500ms response time under test conditions. | `performance-baseline-report.json` | Backend Lead |
| **2.4: Frontend Build & Render Analysis** | Analyze the frontend application's build size, load performance, and Lighthouse scores. | `npm run build --workspace=frontend`<br>`npx lighthouserc` | Lighthouse scores >=85 for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. | Lighthouse report (HTML/JSON). | Frontend Lead |
| **2.5: Security Middleware & Auth Review** | Review the implementation and configuration of Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, and JWT authentication middleware in `backend/src/app.ts` and `backend/src/routes/v1/index.ts`. | Manual Code Review | Security configurations are strict and follow best practices. Authentication gates are correctly applied to all protected routes. | `security-middleware-review.md` | Security Team |

---

### Phase 3: Deep Program (Duration: 1-2 Months)

**Goal:** A comprehensive, end-to-end audit covering complex scenarios, heavy load, and advanced security threats.

| Task | Description | Commands & Tools | Acceptance Criteria | Artifacts | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3.1: End-to-End (E2E) Testing** | Run the full Playwright E2E test suite against a staging environment to validate user flows. | `npx playwright test` | >=90% of E2E tests pass. Critical user journeys (login, media playback, search) are fully functional. | `playwright-report.html` | QA Lead |
| **3.2: API Load Testing** | Use a load testing tool (e.g., k6, Artillery) to stress-test the backend API. Identify bottlenecks in the API, database, and cache. | (Requires new scripts)<br>`k6 run scripts/load-test.js` | The system maintains >99% success rate at 100 concurrent users. P95 latency remains below 800ms. | `load-test-summary.md`<br>Grafana Dashboard | Backend Lead |
| **3.3: Database Query Analysis** | Enable slow query logging in Prisma/Postgres. Analyze expensive queries under load and identify missing indexes or inefficient data access patterns. | Prisma Logging (`log: ['query', 'warn', 'error']`)<br>DB-specific tools (e.g., `pg_stat_statements`) | No queries consistently exceed 100ms. All foreign keys and frequently queried columns are indexed. | `db-query-performance.md` | Backend Lead |
| **3.4: Penetration Testing & Secrets Audit** | Conduct a simulated attack on the staging environment. Audit how secrets are managed and injected into production/staging environments. | ZAP, Burp Suite (manual)<br>Review Docker/K8s configs | No critical or high-severity vulnerabilities found. A clear, secure process for secrets management is documented and followed. | `penetration-test-report.md`<br>`secrets-management-audit.md` | Security Team |
| **3.5: Requirements Traceability & Gap Analysis** | Map existing features and tests back to business requirements (if available). Identify untested features or requirements. | Manual Review of code, tests, and project documentation. | A traceability matrix is created. Test coverage gaps for critical features are identified and ticketed. | `requirements-traceability-matrix.xlsx` | Audit Lead |

## 4. Reports & Dashboards

The following artifacts will be generated and stored in a central location (e.g., a new `audit/` directory or on a MkDocs site page).

*   **Master Audit Report:** A final summary document linking to all other reports and providing a prioritized list of recommended actions.
*   **Test Coverage Dashboard:** An interactive HTML report showing line, branch, and function coverage across the monorepo.
*   **Performance Benchmark Dashboard:** A dashboard (e.g., Grafana, MkDocs page) tracking API latency, throughput, and frontend Lighthouse scores over time.
*   **Security Findings Register:** A consolidated list of all identified security vulnerabilities, their severity, and their resolution status.
*   **Architectural Decision Log:** A log of identified architectural deviations and the decisions made to either correct them or accept them as technical debt.
