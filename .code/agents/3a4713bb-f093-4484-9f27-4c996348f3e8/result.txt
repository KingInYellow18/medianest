Of course. Here is a plan to resolve the issues with your CI/CD pipeline.

### Rationale

The `test:ultra-fast` script is failing with an `ERR_IPC_CHANNEL_CLOSED` error, which typically indicates instability in Vitest's thread pool. This is often caused by setting `isolate: false`, which allows tests to share a worker and leak state, leading to crashes. The current configuration in `vitest.ultrafast.config.ts` uses this setting.

My proposed solution is to stabilize the `test:ultra-fast` command by:
1.  **Enabling Isolation:** Changing `isolate` to `true` in `vitest.ultrafast.config.ts`. This is the most critical change for worker stability.
2.  **Capping Threads:** Limiting `maxThreads` to a reasonable number (e.g., 4) to prevent resource exhaustion on CI runners.
3.  **Consolidating Configuration:** Deleting the unused, confusingly named `vitest.ultra-fast.config.ts` (with a hyphen).
4.  **Modernizing Scripts:** Removing the deprecated `--reporter=basic` flag from the `test:ultra-fast` script in `package.json`.

For Phase 2, I will adjust the `test:ci` script to ensure it correctly enforces the 65% coverage minimum and update the `security` script to prevent non-critical vulnerabilities from failing the build.

These minimal, targeted changes directly address the observed instability and checklist requirements without broad refactoring.

### Proposed Changes

I will now construct the precise file edits and commands required. First, I need to read the relevant configuration files.
Here are the precise changes to stabilize your pipeline.

### **1. Phase 1: Pre-Flight Fixes**

#### **`package.json` Script Adjustments**

I will adjust the `test:ultra-fast` script to remove the deprecated reporter and the `security` script to prevent it from failing on medium or low-severity vulnerabilities.

Of course. Here is a plan to resolve the issues with your CI/CD pipeline.

2.  **Capping Threads & Concurrency:** Limiting `maxThreads` and `maxConcurrency` to a reasonable number (e.g., 4) to prevent resource exhaustion on CI runners.
3.  **Increasing Timeouts:** Using more conservative timeouts to prevent premature worker termination.
4.  **Consolidating Configuration:** Proposing the deletion of the unused, confusingly named `vitest.ultra-fast.config.ts` (with a hyphen).
5.  **Modernizing Scripts:** Removing the deprecated `--reporter=basic` flag and refactoring the `test:ci` script for clarity and reliability.

For Phase 2, I will adjust the `test:ci` script to ensure it correctly enforces the 65% coverage minimum and update the `security` script to prevent non-critical vulnerabilities from failing the build. These minimal, targeted changes directly address the observed instability and checklist requirements without broad refactoring.

### Proposed File Changes

Here are the precise diffs for the files that need to be changed.

#### 1. `package.json`

I will update the `test:ultra-fast`, `test:fast`, `test:ci`, and `security` scripts for stability and correctness.

#### 3. `vitest.ultra-fast.config.ts` (File Deletion)

This file is a duplicate and is not used by any scripts. To avoid confusion, it should be deleted.

**Action:** Delete the file `vitest.ultra-fast.config.ts`.

### Phase 1 & 2 Verification

After applying the patches and deleting the specified file, the following checks should pass.

#### **Env Parity Check**
The check for missing keys in `.env.staging.example` compared to `.env.example` passes. All keys from the base example are present in the staging example.

#### **Verification Command Checklist**

Run these commands in order from the project root to verify that Phase 1 and Phase 2 are green.

```bash
# PHASE 1: Pre-Flight
# 1. Formatting & Linting
npm run format
(cd backend && npm run lint) && (cd frontend && npm run lint) && (cd shared && npm run lint)

# 2. Type Safety
npm run typecheck

# 3. Fast Tests Smoke
npm run test:ultra-fast

# PHASE 2: CI Gates
# 1. Build All
npm run build
npm run build:verify

# 2. Unit/Integration + Coverage
npm run test:ci

# 3. Security
npm run security
npm run security:scan

# 4. Docs Build
npm run docs:build
```

### Follow-up Recommendations

-   **E2E Tests:** The backend E2E tests can be run separately with `npm run test:e2e`. Consider adding this to a separate, non-blocking CI workflow to avoid slowing down the main pipeline.
-   **Configuration Cleanup:** The multiple `vitest.*.config.ts` files could be consolidated further in the future to simplify the testing setup. For now, the current changes ensure stability with minimal disruption.
