COVERAGE_THRESHOLD: 80
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD: 90
SECURITY_THRESHOLD: 85

# Review requirements
MIN_REVIEWERS_MAIN: 2

```

### Repository Settings

Ensure your repository has the following configured:

1. **Branch Protection Rules**: Enable for `main`, `development`, and `test` branches
2. **Required Status Checks**: Configure workflows as required checks
3. **Code Owners**: Set up `.github/CODEOWNERS` for automatic reviewer assignment
4. **Labels**: Create necessary labels for workflow automation

## üë• Reviewer Assignment

### Expertise-Based Assignment

The system automatically assigns reviewers based on file patterns and expertise areas:

| File Pattern | Expertise Area | Assigned Teams |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| `backend/src/controllers/*` | API Design | `backend-team`, `api-reviewers` |
| `backend/src/services/*` | Backend Logic | `backend-team`, `senior-backend` |
| `backend/src/middleware/*` | Security | `backend-team`, `security-reviewers` |
| `frontend/src/components/*` | UI/UX | `frontend-team`, `ui-reviewers` |
| `shared/src/types/*` | TypeScript | `typescript-experts` |
| `.github/workflows/*` | DevOps | `devops-team`, `ci-cd-reviewers` |

### Review Requirements

Review requirements are dynamically determined based on:

- **Branch Criticality**: `main` branch requires 2+ reviewers
- **Complexity Score**: High complexity (70+) requires additional reviewers
- **Critical Files**: Changes to dependencies, configs, or schemas require extra scrutiny
- **PR Type**: Different PR types have different requirements

### Review Priority Levels

| Priority | Conditions | Response Time |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **High** | Hotfixes, main branch PRs, security fixes | 4 hours |
| **Medium** | Feature PRs, complex changes | 24 hours |
| **Low** | Documentation, tests, style changes | 48 hours |

## üéØ Quality Gates

### Gate Evaluation Process

1. **Pre-Analysis**: Determines which quality checks to run based on changed files
2. **Code Quality**: Runs linting, type checking, and calculates quality score
3. **Testing**: Executes relevant test suites with coverage analysis
4. **Security**: Performs dependency audits and vulnerability scanning
5. **Performance**: Runs Lighthouse audits and performance tests
6. **Final Evaluation**: Combines all scores for overall quality assessment

### Quality Score Calculation

```
Overall Score = (Code Quality + Security + Performance) / 3

Where:
- Code Quality = Base 100 - (Linting Errors √ó 30) - (Type Errors √ó 40)
- Security = Base 100 - (Audit Issues √ó 15) - (Vulnerabilities √ó 10)  
- Performance = Lighthouse Score - (Performance Test Failures √ó 20)
```

### Auto-merge Eligibility

PRs are eligible for auto-merge when:
- Overall quality score ‚â• 80
- All required reviews approved
- No security vulnerabilities
- Complexity score < 40
- Specific PR types (dependency updates, documentation, etc.)

## üîî Notification System

### Notification Flow

1. **Context Analysis**: Determines notification type, priority, and target audience
2. **Data Gathering**: Collects relevant information for the notification
3. **Message Formatting**: Creates formatted messages using templates
4. **Multi-Channel Delivery**: Sends to Slack, Teams, and/or GitHub

### Audience Targeting

| Audience | Includes | Notification Types |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Maintainers** | Repository owners, core team | Merges, workflow failures, security issues |
| **Reviewers** | Code review team | Review requests, PR status changes |
| **Contributors** | All contributors | Review feedback, approvals |
| **All Teams** | Everyone | Daily summaries, announcements |

### Message Templates

The system uses context-aware message templates for different notification types:

- **PR Lifecycle**: Opening, merging, closing notifications
- **Review Updates**: Approval, change requests, comments
- **Workflow Results**: Success/failure notifications with links
- **Daily Summaries**: Repository activity overviews

## üõ°Ô∏è Branch Protection

### Protection Rules

The system enforces branch protection through automated validation:

| Branch | Required Reviews | Status Checks | Restrictions |
|--------|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| `main` | 2+ reviewers | All workflows | No force push, no deletions |
| `development` | 1+ reviewer | Quality gates | No force push |
| `test` | 1+ reviewer | Basic checks | Limited restrictions |

### Compliance Monitoring

- **Automated Audits**: Regular compliance score calculation
- **Protection Validation**: Ensures branch protection rules are active
- **Policy Enforcement**: Validates PR compliance with merge policies

gh workflow run "PR Review Coordination" -f pr_number=123 -f action=assign-reviewers

# Run quality gates
gh workflow run "Quality Gate Automation" -f pr_number=123 -f full_scan=true

# Send notifications
gh workflow run "Smart Notification Management" -f notification_type=daily-summary -f target_audience=all-teams
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Workflow Failures

**Problem**: Workflows failing due to permissions
**Solution**: Ensure `GITHUB_TOKEN` has required permissions in workflow files

**Problem**: Quality gates failing unexpectedly
**Solution**: Check individual job outputs and adjust thresholds if needed

#### Reviewer Assignment

**Problem**: No reviewers assigned automatically
**Solution**: Verify CODEOWNERS file exists and team mappings are correct

**Problem**: Wrong reviewers assigned
**Solution**: Update expertise area mappings in workflow configuration

#### Notifications

**Problem**: Slack/Teams notifications not working
**Solution**: Verify webhook URLs are correct and secrets are configured

**Problem**: Too many notifications
**Solution**: Adjust notification conditions and audience targeting

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Workflow Logs**: Review individual job outputs for errors
2. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure all required secrets and variables are set
3. **Test Manual Triggers**: Use workflow dispatch to test specific scenarios
4. **Review Permissions**: Confirm repository and workflow permissions are adequate

### Performance Optimization

- **Conditional Execution**: Workflows only run when relevant files change
- **Parallel Jobs**: Multiple quality checks run simultaneously
- **Caching**: Dependencies and build artifacts are cached
- **Smart Notifications**: Duplicate and low-priority notifications are filtered

## üìä Metrics and Analytics

### Collected Metrics

The system automatically collects metrics for:

- **PR Analysis**: Complexity scores, review times, merge rates
- **Quality Trends**: Test coverage, security scores, performance metrics
- **Review Efficiency**: Assignment accuracy, response times, approval rates
- **Notification Effectiveness**: Delivery rates, engagement metrics

### Accessing Metrics

Metrics are stored as workflow artifacts and can be accessed via:

1. **GitHub Actions UI**: Download artifacts from workflow runs
2. **API Access**: Query workflow run artifacts programmatically
3. **Custom Dashboards**: Import metrics into monitoring tools

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

1. **Weekly**: Review workflow performance and adjust thresholds
2. **Monthly**: Update reviewer mappings and team assignments
3. **Quarterly**: Audit branch protection rules and compliance scores
4. **As Needed**: Update notification templates and webhook configurations

### Updates and Upgrades

When updating workflows:

1. Test changes in a fork or feature branch
2. Use workflow dispatch to validate new functionality
3. Monitor metrics for performance impact
